# MyloWare AI Agent Task Queue

## Purpose

This file serves as the central task queue for AI agents implementing the MyloWare platform. AI agents will add tasks here when they need human intervention, approval, or input.

## Task Status Legend

- üîÑ **PENDING** - Task waiting for human action
- ‚è≥ **IN PROGRESS** - Human is working on the task
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Task finished, ready for AI to continue
- üö´ **BLOCKED** - Task blocked by external dependency
- üìã **INFO** - Information for human reference

## Current Implementation Phase

**Phase:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY FOR AI AGENT IMPLEMENTATION**

## üìã INFO - Implementation Guidelines

### AI Agent Workflow

1. **Start with Epic 1, Story 1.1** - Project Setup and Repository Structure
2. **For each story:**
   - Read the story requirements from `docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-core-infrastructure.md`
   - Implement the technical requirements based on `docs/architecture/`
   - Add any human-required tasks to this file
   - Mark story as complete when all acceptance criteria are met
3. **Move to next story** when current story is complete
4. **Update this file** whenever human intervention is needed

### Human Task Response Format

When completing a task, please use this format:

```markdown
### Task: [Task Name]

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Response:** [Brief description of what was done]  
**Next Action:** [What the AI agent should do next]
```

### Priority Levels

- **HIGH** - Blocks current story progress
- **MEDIUM** - Needed for current story but can work around
- **LOW** - Nice to have, can proceed without

### File Structure
