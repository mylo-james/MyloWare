## üìã INFO - Implementation Guidelines

### AI Agent Workflow
1. **Start with Epic 1, Story 1.1** - Project Setup and Repository Structure
2. **For each story:**
   - Read the story requirements from `docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-core-infrastructure.md`
   - Implement the technical requirements based on `docs/architecture/`
   - Add any human-required tasks to this file
   - Mark story as complete when all acceptance criteria are met
3. **Move to next story** when current story is complete
4. **Update this file** whenever human intervention is needed

### Human Task Response Format

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Response:** [Brief description of what was done]  
**Next Action:** [What the AI agent should do next]
```

### Priority Levels
- **HIGH** - Blocks current story progress
- **MEDIUM** - Needed for current story but can work around
- **LOW** - Nice to have, can proceed without

### File Structure
- **Implementation:** `packages/` directory as defined in architecture
- **Documentation:** `docs/` directory with sharded structure
