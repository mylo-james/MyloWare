## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This story builds on Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. The Redis event bus will integrate with the project structure from Story 1.1, use the database schema from Story 1.2 for outbox pattern, and connect to the Temporal workflows from Story 1.3.

### Data Models

Based on architecture data models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:

**Event-Related Entities:**

- **DeadLetter**: Stores failed events and messages for investigation and reprocessing
- **WorkOrder**: Contains event metadata for workflow orchestration
- **WorkItem**: Generates events for processing status updates
- **Attempt**: Generates events for activity execution tracking

**Event Bus Components:**

- **Outbox Table**: Database table for reliable event publishing
- **Event Streams**: Redis Streams for event storage and delivery
- **Consumer Groups**: Redis consumer groups for load balancing
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Redis Stream for failed event storage

### API Specifications

No external API specifications for this story - this is internal event bus implementation.

**HTTP Client:** Axios 1.6.0 for external service communication

**Redis Configuration:**

- Streams for event storage and delivery
- Consumer groups for load balancing
- Persistence for event durability
- Security and access controls

### Event Bus Architecture

Based on architecture components [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:

**Event Bus Service Components:**

- **Event Publishers**: Publish events to Redis Streams
- **Event Consumers**: Consume events from Redis Streams
- **Consumer Groups**: Load balancing and failover
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed event storage and reprocessing
- **Event Schemas**: Event structure and validation

**Outbox Pattern Implementation:**

1. **Outbox Table**: Database table for reliable event publishing
2. **Outbox Processor**: Background process to publish events
3. **Event Bus**: Redis Streams for event delivery
4. **Event Consumers**: Service-specific event handlers
5. **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed event storage

### Event Types

Based on architecture core workflows [Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md]:

**Workflow Events:**

- `work_order.created` - New work order created
- `work_order.status_changed` - Work order status updated
- `work_item.processing_started` - Work item processing began
- `work_item.processing_completed` - Work item processing completed
- `work_item.processing_failed` - Work item processing failed

**Activity Events:**

- `attempt.started` - Activity attempt started
- `attempt.completed` - Activity attempt completed
- `attempt.failed` - Activity attempt failed
- `attempt.retried` - Activity attempt retried

**System Events:**

- `system.health_check` - System health check
- `system.error` - System error occurred
- `system.maintenance` - System maintenance event

### Environment Variables Required

- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string
- `REDIS_HOST` - Redis host (default: localhost)
- `REDIS_PORT` - Redis port (default: 6379)
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - Redis password (if required)
- `REDIS_DB` - Redis database number (default: 0)
- `EVENT_BUS_CONSUMER_GROUP` - Consumer group name
- `EVENT_BUS_PARTITIONS` - Number of event stream partitions
- `EVENT_BUS_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` - Maximum retry attempts for failed events

### Integration Points
