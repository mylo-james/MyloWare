# Story 1.4: Redis Event Bus Implementation

2. Event bus implementation with outbox→bus→inbox pattern
3. Consumer groups and partitioning strategy established
4. Dead letter queue handling for failed events
5. Event schema definitions and validation

  - [ ] Implement event consumers with at-least-once delivery
- [ ] Task 3: Set up consumer groups and partitioning (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Configure Redis Streams consumer groups
  - [ ] Implement partitioning strategy for event streams
  - [ ] Set up load balancing across consumer instances
  - [ ] Configure consumer group failover and recovery
- [ ] Task 4: Implement dead letter queue handling (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create dead letter queue for failed event processing

  - [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for dead letter events
  - [ ] Create event reprocessing utilities
- [ ] Task 5: Define event schemas and validation (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create event schema definitions for all event types
  - [ ] Implement event validation using Joi 17.11.0
  - [ ] Set up event versioning and compatibility
  - [ ] Create event documentation and examples

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds on Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. The Redis event bus will integrate with the project structure from Story 1.1, use the database schema from Story 1.2 for outbox pattern, and connect to the Temporal workflows from Story 1.3.

### Data Models
Based on architecture data models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:

**Event-Related Entities:**
- **DeadLetter**: Stores failed events and messages for investigation and reprocessing
- **WorkOrder**: Contains event metadata for workflow orchestration
- **WorkItem**: Generates events for processing status updates
- **Attempt**: Generates events for activity execution tracking

**Event Bus Components:**
- **Outbox Table**: Database table for reliable event publishing
- **Event Streams**: Redis Streams for event storage and delivery
- **Consumer Groups**: Redis consumer groups for load balancing
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Redis Stream for failed event storage

### API Specifications
No external API specifications for this story - this is internal event bus implementation.

### Component Specifications
No UI components for this story - this is backend event bus implementation.

### File Locations
Based on architecture source tree [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

**Event Bus Service:**
- `packages/event-bus-service/` - Redis Streams event bus
  - `src/main.ts` - Service entry point
  - `src/publishers/` - Event publishers
  - `src/consumers/` - Event consumers
  - `src/schemas/` - Event schemas
  - `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

**Database Integration:**
- `packages/database-service/` - Outbox table implementation
  - `src/repositories/outbox.repository.ts` - Outbox pattern implementation

**Docker Configuration:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Redis server configuration
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production Redis setup

### Testing Requirements
Based on architecture testing strategy [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:

**Event Bus Testing:**
- Unit tests for event publishers and consumers
- Integration tests for Redis Streams functionality
- End-to-end event flow testing
- Dead letter queue and retry mechanism tests
- Performance testing for event throughput

**Test Coverage:**
- Event publishing and consumption tests
- Consumer group and partitioning tests
- Dead letter queue handling tests
- Event schema validation tests

### Technical Constraints
Based on architecture tech stack [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:

**Event Bus:** Redis 7.2.0 with Streams
**Validation:** Joi 17.11.0 for event schema validation
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15.5 for outbox pattern
**Logging:** Winston 3.11.0 for structured logging
**HTTP Client:** Axios 1.6.0 for external service communication

**Redis Configuration:**
- Streams for event storage and delivery
- Consumer groups for load balancing
- Persistence for event durability
- Security and access controls

### Event Bus Architecture
Based on architecture components [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]:

**Event Bus Service Components:**
- **Event Publishers**: Publish events to Redis Streams
- **Event Consumers**: Consume events from Redis Streams
- **Consumer Groups**: Load balancing and failover
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed event storage and reprocessing
- **Event Schemas**: Event structure and validation

**Outbox Pattern Implementation:**
1. **Outbox Table**: Database table for reliable event publishing
2. **Outbox Processor**: Background process to publish events
3. **Event Bus**: Redis Streams for event delivery
4. **Event Consumers**: Service-specific event handlers
5. **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed event storage

### Event Types
Based on architecture core workflows [Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md]:

**Workflow Events:**
- `work_order.created` - New work order created
- `work_order.status_changed` - Work order status updated
- `work_item.processing_started` - Work item processing began
- `work_item.processing_completed` - Work item processing completed
- `work_item.processing_failed` - Work item processing failed

**Activity Events:**
- `attempt.started` - Activity attempt started
- `attempt.completed` - Activity attempt completed
- `attempt.failed` - Activity attempt failed
- `attempt.retried` - Activity attempt retried

**System Events:**
- `system.health_check` - System health check
- `system.error` - System error occurred
- `system.maintenance` - System maintenance event

### Environment Variables Required
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string
- `REDIS_HOST` - Redis host (default: localhost)
- `REDIS_PORT` - Redis port (default: 6379)
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - Redis password (if required)
- `REDIS_DB` - Redis database number (default: 0)
- `EVENT_BUS_CONSUMER_GROUP` - Consumer group name
- `EVENT_BUS_PARTITIONS` - Number of event stream partitions
- `EVENT_BUS_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` - Maximum retry attempts for failed events

### Integration Points
**With Previous Stories:**
- Uses database schema from Story 1.2 for outbox pattern
- Integrates with project structure from Story 1.1
- Connects to Temporal workflows from Story 1.3

**With Future Stories:**
- Provides event bus for AI agent communication (Epic 3)
- Supports Slack integration events (Epic 2)
- Enables document processing event flows (Epic 4)
