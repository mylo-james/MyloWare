# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Repository Structure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a well-organized monorepo with proper tooling and CI/CD setup,
**so that** I can efficiently develop and deploy the MyloWare platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure established with clear separation of concerns
2. Development environment setup with Docker Compose for local development
3. CI/CD pipeline configured with automated testing and deployment
4. Code quality tools (linting, formatting, security scanning) integrated
5. Documentation structure established with README and contribution guidelines
