## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This story builds on Stories 1.1 and 1.2. The Temporal setup will use the project structure from Story 1.1 and the database schema from Story 1.2 for workflow state persistence.

### Data Models

Based on architecture data models [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]:

**Workflow-Related Entities:**

- **WorkOrder**: Contains `workflow_id` field linking to Temporal workflow
- **WorkItem**: Individual items processed by workflow activities
- **Attempt**: Tracks activity execution attempts and results
- **WorkflowTemplate**: Stores workflow definitions for different document types

**Workflow State Management:**

- Workflow execution state stored in Temporal
- Work order status synchronized with workflow state
- Activity results stored in attempts table
- Workflow metadata stored in work_order.metadata field

### API Specifications

No external API specifications for this story - this is internal workflow orchestration setup.

### Component Specifications

No UI components for this story - this is backend workflow orchestration setup.

### File Locations

Based on architecture source tree [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

**Temporal Service:**

- `packages/workflow-service/` - Temporal workflow orchestration
  - `src/main.ts` - Service entry point
  - `src/workflows/` - Temporal workflow definitions
  - `src/activities/` - Workflow activities implementation
  - `src/services/` - Workflow services
  - `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

**Docker Configuration:**

- `docker-compose.yml` - Temporal server configuration
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production Temporal setup

### Testing Requirements

Based on architecture testing strategy [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:

**Temporal Testing:**

- Unit tests for workflow definitions
- Integration tests for activity implementations
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Retry policy and error handling tests
- Performance testing for workflow execution

**Test Coverage:**

- Workflow definition tests
- Activity implementation tests
- Error handling and recovery tests
- Workflow state management tests

### Technical Constraints

Based on architecture tech stack [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:

**Workflow Engine:** Temporal 1.22.0
**Language:** TypeScript 5.3.3
**Framework:** NestJS 10.3.2 for service implementation
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15.5 for Temporal persistence
**Logging:** Winston 3.11.0 for structured logging

**Temporal Configuration:**

- Deterministic execution with retries and idempotency
- Workflow versioning and compatibility
- Activity timeout and retry policies
- Circuit breaker patterns for external API calls

### Workflow Architecture

Based on architecture core workflows [Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md]:

**Docs Extract & Verify Workflow:**

1. **RecordGen Activity**: Generate initial records and context
2. **ExtractorLLM Activity**: Extract data from documents using LLM
3. **JsonRestyler Activity**: Transform data to consistent JSON format
4. **SchemaGuard Activity**: Validate data against schemas
5. **Persister Activity**: Persist validated data to database
6. **Verifier Activity**: Perform final verification and quality assurance

**Error Handling Strategy:**

- Exponential backoff retry policies
- Circuit breaker for external LLM API calls
- Dead letter queue for failed activities
- Workflow compensation for rollback scenarios

### Environment Variables Required

- `TEMPORAL_HOST` - Temporal server host (default: localhost)
- `TEMPORAL_PORT` - Temporal server port (default: 7233)
- `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE` - Temporal namespace (default: default)
- `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE` - Task queue name (default: myloware-tasks)
- `TEMPORAL_DATABASE_URL` - Temporal database connection string
- `TEMPORAL_UI_HOST` - Temporal UI host (default: localhost)
- `TEMPORAL_UI_PORT` - Temporal UI port (default: 8233)

### Integration Points

**With Previous Stories:**

- Uses database schema from Story 1.2 for workflow state persistence
- Integrates with project structure from Story 1.1
- Connects to Redis event bus (Story 1.4 dependency)

**With Future Stories:**

- Provides workflow orchestration for AI agents (Epic 3)
- Supports human-in-the-loop approval workflows (Epic 2)
- Enables document processing workflows (Epic 4)
