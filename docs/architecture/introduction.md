# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for MyloWare, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
The MyloWare platform is primarily Slack-first with a web-based Run Trace UI for observability. This architecture document covers the core backend systems, while the Run Trace UI frontend architecture will be detailed in a separate Frontend Architecture Document that MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision: N/A - Greenfield Project**

MyloWare is a greenfield project with no existing codebase or starter template dependencies. The architecture will be built from scratch using modern, proven technologies aligned with the PRD requirements.
