story: 2.2.slack-command-implementation
title: Slack Command Implementation
date: 2025-08-18
reviewer: QA.mdc (Quinn)
decision: PASS
rationale:
  - All acceptance criteria satisfied with code and tests in notification-service
  - Signature verification implemented with timestamp freshness checks
  - Env template updated to include WORKFLOW_SERVICE_URL
risks:
  - Ensure raw body capture for Slack signature verification in production
  - User-specific mute is acknowledged but not persisted; acceptable for MVP
evidence:
  tests:
    notification-service: 10/10 passed
    workspace: all packages build and tests pass

    - POST /api/v1/slack/commands (notification-service)
    - POST /api/v1/workflows/docs-extract-verify (workflow-service)
