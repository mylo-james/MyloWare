- **System:** Slack integration
- **Purpose:** Team collaboration and enhanced notifications
- **Benefits:** Rich formatting, team visibility, tool integration

## Migration Plan

### **When Epic 2 is Complete:**

1. **Slack integration** will be implemented

3. **AI agents** will be updated to use Slack
4. **Team collaboration** features will be enabled

### **During Transition:**

- **Both systems** will work simultaneously
- **Gradual migration** from Pushover to Slack
- **No interruption** to notification delivery
- **Backward compatibility** maintained

## Why This Approach?

- **Proven reliability** of Pushover service
- **Simple setup** for immediate use
- **Cross-platform** delivery

### **Future Benefits:**

- **Team collaboration** in Slack channels
- **Rich formatting** and message threading
- **Integration ecosystem** with development tools
- **Better notification management** and search
