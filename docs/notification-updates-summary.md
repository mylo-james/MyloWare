```typescript
import { notifySuccess, notifyStoryComplete } from '@myloware/shared';

notifySuccess('Task completed');
notifyStoryComplete('1.2', 'Database schema implemented');
```

### 3. **Direct Script Calls**
```bash
./scripts/notify-completion.sh "message" priority
node scripts/notify-completion.js "message" priority
```

## Priority Levels

- **0 (Normal):** Standard notifications
- **1 (High):** Important completions (stories, deployments)
- **2 (Emergency):** Errors or critical issues

## What Gets Notified

Each notification includes:
- Custom message from the agent
- Current git branch and commit hash
- Timestamp of completion
- Priority level
- Custom title (optional)

## Benefits

1. **Real-time updates:** Get notified immediately when agents complete work
2. **Progress tracking:** Monitor long-running tasks and story completions
3. **Error awareness:** Get alerted when things go wrong
4. **Workflow visibility:** See the full development pipeline in action
5. **Reduced manual checking:** No need to constantly check for updates

## Setup Required

Agents will automatically use the notification system if:
- `.env` file exists with Pushover credentials
- `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` and `PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN` are set
- Notification scripts are available in the project

The notification system is now fully integrated across all BMAD agent roles! üéâ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Temporary Solution**

**This Pushover notification system is a temporary solution until Slack integration is implemented.** 

### **Timeline:**
- **Current:** Pushover notifications for immediate agent communication
- **Future:** Slack integration for team collaboration and notifications
- **Migration:** Will transition from Pushover to Slack when Epic 2 (Slack Integration) is completed

### **Why Pushover First?**
- **Quick setup:** Immediate notification capability
- **Simple integration:** Easy for AI agents to use
- **Reliable delivery:** Works across all devices
- **Bridge solution:** Keeps you informed while Slack integration is developed

### **Slack Integration Benefits (Future):**
- **Team collaboration:** Notifications visible to entire team
- **Channel organization:** Dedicated channels for different agent types
- **Rich formatting:** Better message formatting and threading
- **Integration ecosystem:** Connects with other development tools
- **Search and history:** Better notification management and search

**The notification system will be enhanced and eventually replaced by Slack integration as part of Epic 2: Slack Integration & HITL Framework.**
