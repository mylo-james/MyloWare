REST API endpoints.

```

}
```

---

  "approved": true,

```

Interactive chat with the supervisor agent.

**Request**:
```json
{
  "message": "What videos should I make today?",
  "session_id": "optional-session-id"
}
```

---

## Webhooks

### Sora Standard Webhook

```
POST /v1/webhooks/sora
```

Called by OpenAI Standard Webhooks when video generation completes or fails.
We resolve `run_id` via the stored CLIP_MANIFEST mapping (task_id -> run_id);
`run_id` query param is supported only for legacy/manual callbacks.

Expected event envelope (minimum fields we rely on):

```json
{
  "object": "event",
  "type": "video.completed",
  "data": {
    "id": "video_..."
  }
}
```

Supported event types: `video.completed`, `video.failed`.

On `video.completed`, MyloWare downloads the MP4 via `GET /v1/videos/{id}/content`
using the OpenAI API key, then transcodes and resumes the workflow.

Captured contract examples (dashboard test webhooks):

```json
{
  "id": "evt_69449cfb31088190a29b3f98a8450ccb",
  "object": "event",
  "created_at": 1766104315,
  "type": "video.completed",
  "data": {
    "id": "video_abc123"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "evt_69449cf62cdc8190a854f95b368a5d4d",
  "object": "event",
  "created_at": 1766104310,
  "type": "video.failed",
  "data": {
    "id": "video_abc123"
  }
}
```

### Remotion Callback

```
POST /v1/webhooks/remotion?run_id={run_id}
```

Called by Remotion service when render completes.
