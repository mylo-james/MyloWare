# Epic 7: API Surface & Integration

**Goal**: Build the REST API surface that enables programmatic access to the platform while maintaining security and governance through capability token authentication.

## Story 7.1: REST API Foundation

As a developer,
I want a REST API for programmatic access to the platform,
so that external systems can integrate with MyloWare capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. REST API with standard HTTP methods and status codes
2. API versioning strategy and backward compatibility
3. Request/response validation and error handling
4. Rate limiting and throttling
5. API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

## Story 7.2: Capability Token Authentication

As a security administrator,
I want secure authentication using capability tokens,
so that API access is properly controlled and audited.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. JWT capability token generation and validation
2. Token scoping with least-privilege access
3. Short-lived tokens (â‰¤15 min TTL) with refresh mechanisms
4. Token revocation and cleanup procedures
5. Audit logging for all API access

## Story 7.3: Core API Endpoints

As a user,
I want core API endpoints for workflow management,
so that I can programmatically create and monitor workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `POST /runs` endpoint for workflow creation
2. `GET /runs/:id` endpoint for run status
3. `GET /runs/:id/trace` endpoint for detailed execution trace
4. `POST /approvals` endpoint for programmatic approvals
5. Error handling and validation for all endpoints

## Story 7.4: API Integration Testing

As a developer,
I want comprehensive API testing to ensure reliability,
so that the API surface works correctly under various conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Unit tests for all API endpoints
2. Integration tests with real database and services
3. Load testing for API performance validation
4. Security testing for authentication and authorization
5. API contract testing for backward compatibility

## Story 7.5: API Documentation and Examples

As a developer,
I want comprehensive API documentation with examples,
so that external developers can easily integrate with the platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with all endpoints
2. Code examples in multiple programming languages
3. Authentication and authorization examples
4. Error handling and troubleshooting guides
5. Integration tutorials and best practices
