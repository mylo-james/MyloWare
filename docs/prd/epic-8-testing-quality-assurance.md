# Epic 8: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Establish comprehensive testing framework including golden set tests, chaos testing, and quality gates that ensure the platform meets reliability and performance requirements.

## Story 8.1: Golden Set Test Implementation
As a QA engineer,
I want golden set tests that validate core functionality,
so that the platform maintains high quality and reliability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Golden set of 12 documents (4× invoice, 4× ticket, 4× status)
2. Automated test execution with 100% pass rate requirement
3. Test result reporting and trend analysis
4. Golden set maintenance and update procedures
5. Integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Story 8.2: Jailbreak and Security Testing
As a security engineer,
I want security testing to validate system robustness,
so that the platform can resist attacks and maintain data integrity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Jailbreak set testing for prompt injection resistance
2. Input validation and sanitization testing
3. Authentication and authorization testing
4. Data privacy and PII handling validation
5. Security vulnerability scanning and remediation

## Story 8.3: Load and Performance Testing
As a performance engineer,
I want load testing to validate system performance,
so that the platform can handle expected workloads efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Load testing with N parallel runs
2. Performance benchmarking against SLOs
3. Stress testing to identify breaking points
4. Performance regression detection
5. Capacity planning and scaling validation

## Story 8.4: Chaos Testing Implementation
As a reliability engineer,
I want chaos testing to validate system resilience,
so that the platform can handle failures gracefully.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Chaos testing for lease expirations and agent failures
2. Network partition and service failure simulation
3. Database and cache failure scenarios
4. Recovery time and data loss validation
5. Chaos engineering runbooks and procedures

## Story 8.5: Quality Gates and Continuous Testing
As a DevOps engineer,
I want quality gates integrated into the CI/CD pipeline,
so that code quality and system reliability are maintained.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
2. Quality gates for code coverage and test results
3. Performance regression detection
4. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
5. Deployment validation and rollback procedures
