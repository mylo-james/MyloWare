# Epic 5: Connector Registry & Tool Framework

**Goal**: Create the connector and tool registry system that enables extensibility and integration with external services while maintaining security and governance.

## Story 5.1: Tool Contract Framework
As a developer,
I want a tool contract framework with JSON Schema validation,
so that all tools have well-defined inputs, outputs, and side effects.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Tool contract schema definition and validation
2. Side effect classification (none, read, write, external)
3. Sensitivity level classification (low, medium, high, critical)
4. Version management for tool contracts
5. Contract compatibility checking

## Story 5.2: Connector Registry Implementation
As a system administrator,
I want a connector registry to manage tool collections,
so that the platform can organize and discover available capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Connector registry with metadata management
2. Tool discovery and listing capabilities
3. Version management for connectors
4. Connector enablement/disablement
5. Registry API for programmatic access

## Story 5.3: Capability Token System
As a security administrator,
I want capability tokens with scoped access to tools and capabilities,
so that the platform can enforce least-privilege access control.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Capability token generation with scoped permissions
2. Token validation and verification
3. Short-lived tokens (â‰¤15 min TTL)
4. Audience-bound token restrictions
5. Token revocation and cleanup

## Story 5.4: MCP Compliance Implementation
As a developer,
I want MCP-compliant connectors for standardized communication,
so that the platform can integrate with external services consistently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MCP protocol implementation (JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket)
2. Standard MCP methods (handshake, discovery, tool execution)
3. Authentication and authorization integration
4. Error handling and backpressure management
5. Health monitoring and status reporting

## Story 5.5: First Connector Implementation
As a developer,
I want to implement the first connector (GitHub) as a proof of concept,
so that the platform can demonstrate real-world integration capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. GitHub connector with basic tools (repo read, PR creation)
2. OAuth authentication and scope management
3. Rate limiting and error handling
4. Tool contract definitions and validation
5. Integration testing with real GitHub API
