# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Create a secure, governed platform that can orchestrate agents, tools, and services to perform any digital work end-to-end
- Balance autonomy with verifiability through deterministic orchestration, typed contracts, and policy-enforced HITL
- Establish Slack as the primary interface with `#mylo-control`, `#mylo-approvals`, and `#mylo-feed` channels
- Deliver deterministic workflow execution with recoverability guarantees using Temporal
- Implement operator-ready platform with SLOs, runbooks, cost budgets, and audit logs
- Create extensible platform with first-class connector and tool registry with contract versioning
- Build memory with provenance: importance + decay; citations required for LLM outputs

## Background Context

MyloWare addresses the growing need for secure, governed AI-powered digital work orchestration. Current solutions lack the combination of autonomy and verifiability needed for enterprise adoption. The platform solves this by providing deterministic orchestration with typed contracts, JSON-schema validation, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) approvals for risky actions.

The MVP focuses on "Docs: Extract & Verify" workflow as the proving ground for reliability rails and governance, establishing Slack as the front door while building toward a comprehensive platform for content & knowledge, software & DevOps, data & analytics, commerce & operations, and design & media workflows.
