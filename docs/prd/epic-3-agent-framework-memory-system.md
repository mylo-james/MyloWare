# Epic 3: Agent Framework & Memory System

**Goal**: Build the agent orchestration framework using OpenAI Agents SDK and implement the importance-scored memory system that provides context and knowledge to agents while maintaining proper governance.

## Story 3.1: OpenAI Agents SDK Integration

As a developer,
I want to integrate OpenAI Agents SDK for all agent implementations,
so that the platform can leverage proven agent orchestration capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. OpenAI Agents SDK integrated and configured
2. Agent base classes and interfaces established
3. Tool integration framework implemented
4. Agent lifecycle management (start, stop, health check)
5. Agent configuration and environment setup

## Story 3.2: Agent Persona Management

As a system administrator,
I want to manage agent personas with concurrency limits and fair scheduling,
so that the platform can efficiently utilize resources while preventing conflicts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Persona configuration with concurrency limits
2. Fair scheduling algorithm implementation
3. Agent mutex to prevent double checkout
4. Persona health monitoring and alerting
5. Dynamic persona scaling capabilities

## Story 3.3: Memory System Implementation

As a developer,
I want an importance-scored memory system with decay and tiering,
so that agents can access relevant context while maintaining performance and cost efficiency.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Memory storage with pgvector for embeddings
2. Importance scoring algorithm implementation
3. Memory decay and tiering (hot → warm → cold)
4. Namespace management for team, task, and persona memory
5. Memory compaction and cleanup processes

## Story 3.4: Citation and Provenance Tracking

As a user,
I want LLM outputs to include citations and provenance information,
so that I can understand the sources of information and maintain audit trails.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Citation tracking in LLM outputs via used_mem_ids
2. Provenance information stored with memory entries
3. Citation validation and verification
4. Audit trail for memory access and usage
5. Citation display in user interfaces

## Story 3.5: Memory Retrieval and Context Building

As a developer,
I want efficient memory retrieval and context building for agents,
so that they can access relevant information while staying within token budgets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Semantic search using pgvector embeddings
2. Context building with importance-weighted selection
3. Token budget management for context size
4. Diversity filtering to avoid redundant information
5. Memory access performance optimization
