# Epic List

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (User-Centric)**
Establish the foundational platform infrastructure with simplified microservices architecture, Temporal workflows, PostgreSQL database, Redis event bus, and basic services. This epic delivers the core technical foundation while providing an initial health-check endpoint to demonstrate functionality. Focus on operational stability, security-first approach, risk monitoring framework, cost optimization, and user-centric design principles to reduce learning curve and integration complexity.

**Epic 2: Slack Integration & HITL Framework (Adoption-Critical)**
Implement Slack app integration with Socket Mode, approval cards, and the human-in-the-loop policy framework. This epic establishes the primary user interface and governance capabilities with comprehensive security testing, penetration testing, and fallback communication channels. Address critical security concerns while enabling rapid user adoption through deep Slack integration, real-time updates, and streamlined approval workflows that meet user experience priorities.

**Epic 3: Agent Framework & Memory System (Accuracy-Critical)**
Build the agent orchestration framework using OpenAI Agents SDK with strict token budgeting, cost controls, and multi-provider strategy. Implement simplified memory system with basic vector storage for MVP. This epic delivers the AI-first architecture while managing critical LLM API reliability and cost escalation risks through optimization and alternative provider strategies to achieve 95%+ accuracy targets and 50% error reduction.

**Epic 4: Docs Extract & Verify Workflow (User-Value-Critical)**
Implement the core MVP workflow with all required agents (RecordGen, ExtractorLLM, JsonRestyler, SchemaGuard, Persister, Verifier). This epic delivers the primary business value with performance optimization, caching strategies, and comprehensive error handling to achieve critical SLO targets and prevent performance failures while generating immediate customer value, 50% time savings, and clear error recovery procedures that address user pain points.

**Epic 5: Observability & Operations (Visibility-Critical)**
Implement comprehensive observability including Run Trace UI, dashboards, SLOs, and operational runbooks. This epic ensures the platform is production-ready with automated monitoring, alerting, and operational procedures to manage distributed system complexity and provide real-time risk monitoring while optimizing operational costs and resource utilization. Focus on real-time updates and visibility that users expect.

**Epic 6: API Surface & Integration (Flexibility-Critical)**
Build the REST API surface with capability token authentication and programmatic access capabilities. This epic enables integrations with comprehensive security testing, JWT token lifecycle management, and data privacy compliance to address high-risk compliance violations while enabling enterprise sales and revenue expansion. Address integration complexity barriers through simplified integration patterns and comprehensive documentation.

**Epic 7: Testing & Quality Assurance (Reliability-Critical)**
Establish comprehensive testing framework including golden set tests, chaos testing, and quality gates. This epic ensures reliability through extensive testing for all critical paths, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks to mitigate technical risks and protect against costly production issues and customer churn. Focus on error handling and recovery procedures that users prioritize.

**Epic 8: Business Metrics & Go-to-Market (Adoption-Critical)**
Implement business metrics tracking, ROI dashboards, and go-to-market features. This epic supports the competitive positioning with cost monitoring, budget management, and user adoption tracking to address competitive market pressure and user adoption challenges while achieving $50K MRR by month 12 and <$500 CAC targets. Include comprehensive training and support to address change resistance and learning curve barriers.
