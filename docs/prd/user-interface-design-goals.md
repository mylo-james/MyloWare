# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The interface should prioritize clarity, control, and transparency. Users need to understand what the system is doing, why it's doing it, and have appropriate control over the process. The Slack-first approach ensures accessibility and familiarity while providing rich interactive capabilities. The design must support the governance-first approach while maintaining excellent user experience across all user personas and use cases.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Command-driven**: Slash commands for primary actions with clear feedback and status updates
- **Approval-driven**: Interactive cards for HITL decisions with enhanced context and mobile-optimized decision options
- **Thread-based**: Organized communication in dedicated channels with proper threading and context preservation
- **Traceable**: Clear visibility into workflow execution and outcomes with detailed run traces
- **Mobile-responsive**: Consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices with touch-optimized interfaces
- **Batch-enabled**: Support for processing multiple documents simultaneously with bulk operations
- **Collaborative**: Communication features between different user types for coordinated workflows

## Core Screens and Views

- **Slack Commands Interface**: Primary interaction point for all users with intuitive slash commands and batch processing support
- **Enhanced Approval Cards**: Interactive decision points for approvers with detailed context, bulk approval capabilities, and mobile optimization
- **Run Trace UI**: Detailed workflow visualization and debugging with mobile-responsive design and export functionality
- **Dashboard Views**: Operational monitoring and health status with simplified metrics for MVP and real-time updates
- **API Endpoints**: Programmatic access for integrations with comprehensive documentation and testing tools
- **User Onboarding**: Guided setup and training for new users with interactive tour and practice mode
- **Mobile Dashboard**: Simplified mobile interface for critical functions with offline capability for essential features
- **Collaboration Hub**: Communication and coordination features between different user personas
- **Export & Reporting**: Easy export of extracted data with multiple format options (CSV, Excel, JSON)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The system must meet WCAG AA standards for accessibility, ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and screen reader compatible. This includes Slack interface elements, approval cards, web-based dashboards, and mobile interfaces. Special attention must be paid to touch interfaces and mobile accessibility.

## Branding

The system should maintain a professional, trustworthy appearance that reflects the governance and security focus of the platform. Design elements should convey reliability, transparency, and control while remaining approachable for users. The interface should build confidence through clear feedback and successful interactions.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary interface through Slack (mobile and desktop), with supporting web UI for Run Trace and dashboards. All web components must be mobile-responsive and provide consistent experience across devices. Mobile experience must be optimized for touch interfaces and include offline capabilities for critical functions.

## User Experience Success Metrics

- **Time to First Success**: New users should be able to process their first document within 5 minutes
- **Approval Decision Time**: Approvers should be able to make decisions within 2 minutes of receiving approval requests
- **Error Resolution Time**: Issues should be resolvable within 10 minutes through clear error messages and resolution paths
- **User Satisfaction**: Platform should achieve >90% user satisfaction through intuitive design and reliable performance
- **Mobile Usability**: All critical functions should be fully usable on mobile devices with touch-optimized interfaces
