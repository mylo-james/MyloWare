# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
All components will be managed in a single repository to ensure consistency, shared tooling, and simplified deployment.

## Service Architecture: Microservices
The system will be built as a collection of microservices communicating via MCP protocol, with clear boundaries between orchestration, policy, memory, and connector services.

## Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration
Comprehensive testing including unit tests for individual components, integration tests for service interactions, and end-to-end tests for complete workflows.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
