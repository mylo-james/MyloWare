# Epic 6: Observability & Operations

**Goal**: Implement comprehensive observability including Run Trace UI, dashboards, SLOs, and operational runbooks that enable effective monitoring and incident response.

## Story 6.1: Run Trace UI Implementation

As a user,
I want a Run Trace UI to visualize workflow execution,
so that I can understand what the system is doing and debug issues effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Run Trace UI with workflow visualization
2. Step-by-step execution details and timing
3. Error highlighting and debugging information
4. Correlation ID tracking throughout the trace
5. Export capabilities for analysis and reporting

## Story 6.2: Dashboard Implementation

As an operator,
I want comprehensive dashboards for monitoring system health,
so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Run Trace dashboard with execution metrics
2. Board Status dashboard for work order management
3. Persona Health dashboard for agent monitoring
4. Token Spend dashboard for cost tracking
5. Approvals dashboard for HITL decision tracking

## Story 6.3: SLO Implementation and Alerting

As an operator,
I want SLOs with alerting for performance and reliability,
so that the system can maintain high quality of service.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. SLO definitions for p95 latency, success rates, and error rates
2. Alerting rules and notification channels
3. SLO dashboard with trend analysis
4. Error budget tracking and reporting
5. Escalation procedures for SLO violations

## Story 6.4: Structured Logging and Tracing

As a developer,
I want structured logging and distributed tracing,
so that I can effectively debug issues across the distributed system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Structured logging (JSON) throughout all services
2. OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
3. Correlation ID propagation across all components
4. Log aggregation and search capabilities
5. Performance monitoring and bottleneck identification

## Story 6.5: Runbooks and Incident Management

As an operator,
I want comprehensive runbooks and incident procedures,
so that I can effectively respond to and resolve issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Runbook documentation for common scenarios
2. Incident response procedures and escalation paths
3. Post-incident review and learning processes
4. Knowledge base for troubleshooting
5. Training materials for new operators
