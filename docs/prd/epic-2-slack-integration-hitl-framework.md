# Epic 2: Slack Integration & HITL Framework

**Goal**: Implement the Slack app integration that will serve as the primary user interface, along with the human-in-the-loop approval framework that ensures governance and control over automated processes.

## Story 2.1: Slack App Configuration and Installation
As a user,
I want to install and configure the MyloWare Slack app,
so that I can interact with the platform through familiar Slack channels.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Slack app created with required scopes and permissions
2. Socket Mode enabled for MVP deployment
3. App installation process documented and tested
4. Required channels (#mylo-control, #mylo-approvals, #mylo-feed) created
5. Bot user configured with appropriate permissions

## Story 2.2: Slack Command Implementation
As a user,
I want to use slash commands to interact with the platform,
so that I can easily start workflows, check status, and communicate with the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `/mylo new` command implemented with workflow template selection
2. `/mylo status` command with run_id parameter for status checking
3. `/mylo talk` command for conversational interaction
4. `/mylo stop` and `/mylo mute` commands for workflow control
5. Command signature verification and error handling

## Story 2.3: Approval Card System
As an approver,
I want interactive approval cards for human-in-the-loop decisions,
so that I can review and approve or deny automated actions that require human oversight.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Approval card generation with context and decision options
2. Interactive buttons for approve, deny, skip, and abort actions
3. Approval event recording in database with audit trail
4. Soft gate timeout handling with auto-approval
5. Hard gate blocking until human decision

## Story 2.4: Policy Engine Implementation
As a system administrator,
I want a configurable policy engine that can make automated decisions,
so that the platform can handle routine approvals while escalating complex decisions to humans.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Policy engine with declarative rule configuration
2. Support for allow, soft_gate, and deny outcomes
3. Policy evaluation based on capability, tool metadata, and context
4. Timeout configuration for soft gates
5. Policy dry-run mode for testing

## Story 2.5: Channel Management and Threading
As a user,
I want organized communication in dedicated channels with proper threading,
so that I can easily track workflow progress and maintain context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Run updates posted as threads in #mylo-feed keyed by run_id
2. Approval requests posted to #mylo-approvals channel
3. General commands and chat in #mylo-control channel
4. Thread management and cleanup strategies
5. Message formatting with consistent styling and metadata
