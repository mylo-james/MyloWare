# Cloudflare Tunnel Credentials

Copy the `mcp-vector` tunnel credential JSON file generated by `cloudflared tunnel create mcp-vector` into this directory and name it `mcp-vector.json`. The docker-compose stack mounts the file at `/etc/cloudflared/credentials.json` inside the `cloudflared` container.

> The credentials file is sensitive. Do not commit it to version control. The `.gitignore` rules keep the JSON out of git while allowing this README to remain.

You also need the Cloudflare origin certificate stored at `cloudflared/cert.pem`. Run `cloudflared tunnel login` on your host, then copy the resulting `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem` into the repository root under `cloudflared/cert.pem` (git-ignored by default).
