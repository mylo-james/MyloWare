Cinematic Prompting with Veo 3: Screenwriter’s Knowledge Base
Introduction
Google’s Veo 3 is an advanced text-to-video model that turns written prompts into high-definition short clips with synchronized audio[1][2]. Unlike earlier “prompt-and-pray” approaches, Veo 3 lets screenwriters direct the AI more precisely – treating your prompt like a concise director’s note[3]. By writing detailed screen directions (camera angles, lighting cues, dialogue, etc.), you can achieve cinematic accuracy and narrative coherence in AI-generated videos[4]. The key is crafting structured, unambiguous prompts that clearly communicate the scene you envision.
Veo 3 Capabilities: Veo 3 can generate up to 8-second 720p or 1080p clips (16:9 landscape or 9:16 portrait) with ~24 FPS and native audio[5][6]. It can produce realistic sound (dialogue, ambient noise, sound effects) in sync with the visuals[7][1]. It also supports special features like image-to-video (animating a given image) and multi-shot workflows (e.g. using “first and last frame” for smooth transitions, or combining reference images for consistency)[8][9]. All AI-generated videos include a subtle watermark (Google’s SynthID metadata) to mark them as machine-generated[10].
Focus on Cinematic Quality: This guide emphasizes prompt precision, cinematic techniques, and scene design over gimmicks or virality. By treating your prompt as a mini-script with film language, you can guide Veo’s “virtual camera” to produce shots that look like real movies[3]. Below, we break down best practices for writing Veo 3 prompts – including how to describe shots, camera movement, lighting, pacing, audio, and more – so that an autonomous agent (or any creator) can reliably generate high-quality TikToks, Shorts, or other short-form videos with a cinematic flair.
Prompt Structure and Key Elements
To get consistent results, structure your prompt to cover all the important elements of the scene. A reliable formula (adapted from Google’s guidance) is:
[Cinematography] + [Subject] + [Action] + [Context] + [Style/Ambiance] + [Audio][11][12].
In practice, this means specifying: - Subject: Who or what is the focus (character, object, etc.)[12]. Describe the subject with specific details (e.g. appearance, age, attire) to give the AI a clear mental image. For example: “a 30-something woman in a yellow raincoat”[13].- Action: What the subject is doing in the scene[14]. Use vivid, active verbs (walking, whispering, turning a key, etc.), and keep it to one main action or moment per 4–8 second clip. For example: “power-walks through a neon-lit alley”[13].- Context/Setting: Where and when the scene takes place[15]. Describe the location, era, time of day, weather, or background activity. This grounds the scene (e.g. “a neon-lit Tokyo alley at night, puddles on the ground”[13]). If multiple characters or elements are present, use distinguishing details to avoid confusion (e.g. “the man in the red hat” vs “the woman in the blue dress” to tell characters apart)[16].- Cinematography (Shot & Camera): The framing, angle, and camera movement for the shot[17]. Indicate if it’s a close-up, medium shot, or wide shot, a low-angle or aerial view, etc., and note any camera motion like tracking, panning, dolly-in/out, or POV[17][18]. This tells Veo “where to place the camera” and how to move it, which dramatically affects the tone. For example: “Medium tracking shot at chest height, gentle dolly-in”[13].- Style & Ambiance: The overall aesthetic, mood, lighting, and color tone[19][20]. Include descriptive adjectives for the visual style (e.g. “cinematic, retro 1980s look, slightly grainy”[21] or “surreal, high contrast, dreamy”), as well as lighting and color cues (“cool blue tones, low-key lighting” for a somber mood, or “warm golden hour sunlight” for a hopeful mood[22]). These help convey the emotional tone.- Audio: (Optional but recommended) Describe the soundtrack – dialogue, sound effects (SFX), ambient sounds, music – if any[23][24]. This can be in a separate sentence. For instance, specify if a character speaks a line, if there’s background music, or key sounds (e.g. “Audio: distant traffic hum; soft rain patter; no music”). We cover audio in detail later, but note that including audio cues can greatly enhance the realism of the generated video[25][26].
A good prompt will often read like a brief excerpt from a screenplay or shot list, touching on each of these elements. It’s helpful to break the prompt into a couple of sentences for clarity: one describing the visuals (subject, action, setting, style, camera) and another describing the audio or dialogue. Strive to be specific and concrete – avoid abstract terms alone like “make it cool and cinematic” without details, as the model responds better to visual language (e.g. describe lighting, lens, color) than to vague adjectives[27].
Example – Vague vs. Precise Prompt:- Vague: “A person walks outside at night. Cinematic.” (This lacks detail – result may be unpredictable.)- Precise: “A 30-something woman in a yellow raincoat power-walks through a neon-lit Tokyo alley at night. Medium tracking shot at chest height, 35mm lens, gentle dolly-in. Puddles reflect neon signs; mist drifts in the air. Cool-blue key light with magenta rim lighting from behind. Footsteps splash on wet pavement; distant traffic hum; a soft synth pad plays. She says: ‘Let’s move’ (no subtitles). Hold framing steady at the end.”[13].
In the precise version above, we’ve layered in all the key elements: subject and action (woman power-walks), setting (Tokyo alley at night with puddles, mist), camera work (medium tracking shot, dolly-in, specific lens), style (neon-lit, cool blue/magenta lighting, cinematic), audio (footsteps, traffic, music pad), and even a line of dialogue. This level of detail gives Veo very clear instructions – akin to what a director might tell a film crew – resulting in far more controlled and high-quality output than a terse prompt. The prompt is still concise (just a few sentences) but rich with information.
Example of a well-specified prompt brought to life. Here, the prompt described a medium shot of a tired corporate worker at night in a cluttered 1980s office, lit by harsh fluorescent lights and the green glow of a computer screen[21]. Veo generates a frame that matches those directions: the composition, lighting, and mood align with the prompt.
Cinematography in Text Prompts
Using the language of cinematography in your prompt is one of the most powerful ways to control Veo 3’s output[28]. As a screenwriter, you can explicitly “direct the camera” through text, specifying how the shot is framed and moves. Key cinematography aspects to consider in prompts include shot composition, camera angle, camera movement, and lens effects.
Shot Composition & Framing
Indicate what type of shot the AI should frame. Common options include: - Wide shot / Establishing shot: Captures a broad view of the setting and subjects, good for context. E.g. “Wide shot of a mountain landscape at dawn”.- Medium shot: Framed from roughly waist-up (for a person), balances subject and some background. Often used for dialogue or moderate action.- Close-up: Tight framing on a subject’s face or an object, highlighting detail or emotion. Extreme close-ups zoom in even further (eyes, hands on an object, etc.)[29].- Two-shot: A shot with two characters visible (e.g. a conversation) – you can specify “two-shot of A and B sitting at a table”.- Over-the-shoulder: Camera looks from behind one character’s shoulder, focusing on another subject – useful for dialogues.- Low-angle vs. High-angle: Low-angle means camera looks up at the subject (making them appear powerful or imposing), high-angle means looking down on them (can imply vulnerability).- POV shot: A shot from a character’s own perspective (useful for immersive feel).
Mentioning the composition in the prompt guides Veo’s “framing”. For example: “extreme close-up of an eye with city lights reflected in it” will focus tightly on that detail[30], whereas “wide aerial shot of the city skyline” yields a expansive view. If you want the camera at a particular height or distance, say so (chest-level, eye-level, far away, etc.). Composition keywords like close-up, wide shot, low-angle, POV are well-understood by the model[31][32].
Camera Movement and Angles
Dynamic camera instructions can add a cinematic feel. You can direct the “virtual camera” with terms for movement: - Tracking shot: The camera moves along with the subject (side-to-side or following) – e.g. “tracking shot following the character as she walks”.- Dolly-in / Dolly-out: A smooth movement toward or away from the subject. “Slow dolly-in on his face to emphasize emotion”[33].- Pan / Tilt: Panning is a horizontal turn of the camera, tilting is a vertical pivot. “Slow pan across the room from left to right”, or “tilt up from the character’s feet to her face”.- Crane shot: Camera moving on a vertical axis (often starting low and rising high). For instance: “Crane shot starting low on a lone hiker and ascending high above, revealing a colossal mist-filled canyon at sunrise”[34]. This prompt would cause the camera to lift up dramatically, showing scale.- Handheld / Steadicam: Indicate if the camera is shaky or smooth. “Handheld camera, slightly shaky as in a documentary” gives a realistic, on-the-ground feel (great for action or documentary styles)[35]. Conversely, “locked-off tripod shot, no camera movement” ensures a completely stable frame[36]. If you notice the AI adding unintended camera drift, explicitly add “no camera movement” or “steady shot” as a constraint[36].- POV moving: Combining POV with movement, e.g. “a POV shot running through the woods” (camera bobbing as if the viewer runs).- Drone or Aerial view: For high vantage shots: “aerial drone shot circling above the scene”.
By specifying these, you inject a sense of motion and perspective. For example, “The camera dollies in, revealing the tension in his face” or “an aerial view slowly orbiting the island” are directives Veo can interpret[17][37]. Always match the camera movement to the mood: a frantic action scene might call for quick cuts or shaky cam, while a dramatic reveal might use a smooth crane or dolly for emphasis.
Lens & Focus (Depth of Field)
You can also hint at lens characteristics: - Shallow depth of field: Only the subject is in focus, background blurred (bokeh). Use phrases like “shallow depth of field” or “background out of focus”. This draws attention to the subject and can create an intimate or dreamy mood[38].- Deep focus: Everything in frame is sharp (use “deep focus” if needed, though by default many shots will have moderate depth of field).- Wide-angle lens: Exaggerates perspective (good for landscapes or a comedic feel).- Telephoto lens: Compresses distance, often used for close-ups with blurred background. You can specify focal length or lens type if you want, e.g. “85mm lens close-up” for a portrait look[39].- Macro lens: For extreme close detail of small objects (e.g. “macro shot of a drop of water”).- Rack focus: (If needed, though complex) indicating a focus shift from one subject to another – this might be harder for the model to do in one continuous shot, but you could prompt it as a concept.
Using shallow depth of field and color tone to set mood. In this example, the prompt described a close-up with very shallow depth of field of a young woman on a bus at night, with city lights blurred in the background and her faint reflection in the window[40]. The result is a moody, introspective shot: the subject’s face is in focus while the urban lights behind her turn into cinematic bokeh, and the cool blue ambiance reinforces a melancholic tone.
Tip: When mentioning lens or focus, also mention lighting and color to fully shape the image. In the above example, note how “cool blue tones” and a rainy city at night were included to accentuate the mood[41]. Depth of field and lighting together direct the viewer’s eye and emotions.
Composition Continuity Across Shots
If you plan to generate multiple shots (e.g., separate clips for a sequence), keep the visual style consistent. Re-use the same descriptors for characters and ambiance across prompts so the AI doesn’t drift in appearance or tone[42]. For example, if you have two shots of the same character, make sure to describe them the same way each time (same clothing, descriptors) and copy the “style” portion of the prompt (lighting, color, etc.) to each clip[42]. This acts like continuity direction, helping Veo maintain consistency. Veo 3’s “ingredients to video” feature can also assist by letting you provide reference images for characters or scenes, ensuring continuity in multi-shot sequences[9][43] – but even without that, consistent text descriptions are important. (More on multi-shot techniques in Transitions and Pacing below.)
Lighting, Color, and Mood
Lighting is crucial in film, and your prompt should treat it as such. Veo 3 understands many lighting terms, so don’t hesitate to specify the quality, source, and color of light in your scene[44]. This not only makes the visuals more precise but also sets the mood.
	•	Lighting Style: Mention if the scene is brightly lit, dim, high-contrast, etc. For instance, “harsh fluorescent overhead lighting” gives a cold, unflattering look[21], whereas “soft diffused morning light” suggests a gentle, warm feel. Other examples: “dramatic Rembrandt lighting from the side (triangle of light on face)”, “rim lighting outlining the subject”, “neon signage casting colored light”, “candle-lit scene with flickering shadows”. Veo can interpret these real cinematography terms to adjust the rendering[45]. If a particular lighting technique is desired (e.g. chiaroscuro, silhouette, lens flare), include that.
	•	Light Direction & Source: You can be specific about where the light comes from (key light direction). e.g. “warm key light from camera left, soft fill from below, blue backlight”[46]. This level of detail can be used to correct a mood if initial output isn’t right – for example, if you described a moody scene but it came out too flat, adding “low-key lighting with strong shadows” will push it darker. Conversely, for a cheerful scene: “bright, even lighting (like midday sun or a well-lit room)”.
	•	Time of Day & Color Temperature: Use times or Kelvin if needed: “golden hour sunlight” (warm, around 3000–4000K) vs “cool dawn light” (bluish, ~5600K)[44]. Phrases like “sunset orange glow”, “pale moonlight”, or “overcast gray light” immediately set a mood. Also mention weather if relevant (rainy scenes might have diffused lighting with reflections, etc.).
	•	Color Palette / Tones: Deliberately mention color tones to reinforce mood. For example, “cool blue and teal tones for a somber mood”, or “muted orange warm tones for a nostalgic feel”. You can even say “color palette: deep blues and silvers” if you want to guide the overall color scheme[47]. Veo recognizes that color influences emotional impact[22]. If you want black-and-white or sepia, explicitly say “black and white film noir style” or “vintage sepia-tone”.
	•	Contrast & Atmosphere: If it’s a high-contrast scene (think noir), you might say “sharp shadows and a single hard light”. If it’s low-contrast, “soft lighting with gentle shadows”. You can incorporate atmospheric elements too: “foggy scene lit by headlights”, “hazy sunlight with dust in the air catching the light”, etc. These details add realism (Veo 3 does simulate some physics of light and particles) and mood[48][49].
Mood Words: In addition to technical terms, include mood descriptors in plain language – e.g. “somber mood”, “tense and suspenseful”, “uplifting and bright”. While the model mainly relies on concrete details, stating the intended mood can help it resolve any ambiguity in favor of that tone.
Example – Lighting for Mood: “A lone figure stands under a streetlamp at midnight – low-key lighting with deep shadows enveloping the scene. The lamp’s light is a cold blue (5600K), casting long shadows on the wet pavement. Distant neon signs glow faintly in the background, providing hints of color. Moody, high-contrast noir atmosphere.” This prompt segment sets a very clear dark, film-noir mood via lighting and color cues. Veo would likely produce a chiaroscuro effect with the figure partly illuminated and much of the frame in darkness. If instead you wanted a welcoming feel, you might say “warm, soft lighting (like a 40W tungsten lamp), gentle shadows” and mention warm colors.
Finally, remember that lighting must match the narrative mood. If a draft output’s lighting doesn’t match what you envisioned, adjust the prompt rather than hoping the AI guesses. For instance, “Lighting doesn’t match mood – Fix: specify temperature and direction: ‘golden-hour key from camera-left; cool fill; neon magenta rim’.”[46]. This kind of tweak can transform a scene from dull to dramatic or vice versa.
Describing Characters, Actions, and Scenes
When writing prompts for Veo 3, you are essentially writing screen directions for characters and environments. Clarity and specificity here are critical for the AI to “understand” your scene.
	•	Characters and Appearance: Introduce any character with a brief but vivid description. Include attributes like age, clothing, hair style/color, notable features, and even expression if important (e.g. “a weary middle-aged detective in a rumpled suit, with a mustache and tired eyes”). These details help the AI generate a consistent character. If multiple characters are present, identify them distinctly: e.g. “a young girl in a red coat” vs “an older woman in a shawl.” Use these identifiers consistently if referring to them again in the same prompt or across prompts[16]. Veo 3 can maintain character consistency within a single video reasonably well, especially if clearly described; for multiple shots/clips, consider using the same descriptors or the “ingredients” (reference image) feature[9] for continuity. Also, specify emotions or expressions if relevant: “looks angry,” “smiling warmly,” “eyes wide with fear,” etc. The model has some understanding of facial expressions and body language in response to such cues[50].
	•	Actions: Keep the described action focused and present-tense. Since each Veo clip is only a few seconds, aim for one primary action or beat per prompt. For example: “the detective sighs and tosses his badge onto the desk” or “she runs toward the closing train doors”. You can include a secondary simultaneous action if it makes sense (e.g. “…as rain pours down around her”). Avoid packing a sequence of multiple different actions into one prompt – if you need a series (first A happens, then B, then C), you might either break it into separate prompts or use advanced timestamp prompting (discussed later) to script the timeline. Overloading a single prompt with too many actions or events can confuse the AI or result in rushed, incoherent output[51][52]. One guideline: 1–2 significant actions per 8-second clip is a good rule of thumb[51].
	•	Locations and Environment: Set the scene with concrete details. Instead of “outside” or “in a city,” specify “a narrow cobblestone street in Paris, early 1900s” or “a crowded modern office with fluorescent lights”. Name relevant props or environmental elements: “stacks of papers and a flickering neon sign”, “snow-covered pine trees swaying in the wind”. If the scene is fictional or fantastical, you can still describe it richly (e.g. “on the bridge of a futuristic starship, holographic screens glowing around”). The environment often dictates the background visuals – and the model will fill in missing pieces, but you have control to guide it. Also incorporate weather or atmosphere if important (fog, rain, firelight, etc., as these can greatly affect the visuals and mood).
	•	Transitions and Scene Changes: If you want to depict a transition (like going from one scene or angle to another), you have a couple of options:
	•	Single Prompt, Implied Cut: You can describe two shots in one prompt separated by a transition word, but this is risky unless using the timestamp format. For example: “Wide shot of the castle exterior at dusk. Cut to: interior throne room, torch-lit, as the king stands.” The model might attempt to blend these or might just focus on one. Generally, plain “Cut to:” text won’t reliably produce a clean cut in the generated video, because Veo typically renders one continuous scene unless instructed via the timestamp method (below).
	•	Timestamp Prompting: Veo 3.1 introduced the ability to script multiple segments in one go by prefixing each segment description with a time code range[53]. For example:
	•	[00:00-00:02] Medium shot behind an explorer pushing aside a jungle vine to reveal a hidden path.  [00:02-00:04] Reverse shot of her face, eyes wide in awe as she sees ancient ruins. SFX: distant exotic bird calls.  [00:04-00:06] Tracking shot following her into the clearing towards the moss-covered temple. Emotion: wonder.  [00:06-00:08] Wide crane shot revealing the lone explorer tiny among vast jungle ruins. SFX: gentle orchestral music swells.
	•	This format explicitly allocates time slots to different shots[54][55]. Veo will attempt to stitch them into one clip with those timings and transitions. It’s a powerful way to control pacing and cuts within the 8-second limit. Use it to storyboard a mini-sequence: note that each segment only has ~2 seconds here, so keep each segment’s action simple. Timestamp prompting is advanced, and results may vary, but it gives you direct control over multi-shot pacing in one generation[54]. Make sure the total time doesn’t exceed Veo’s max (typically 00:08 for 8 seconds).
	•	Separate Prompts & Post-Editing: Often, it’s simpler to generate separate clips for each shot and then edit them together externally. For example, prompt one 4-sec clip of the castle exterior, and another 4-sec clip of the throne room, then manually cut them together. If you choose this route, ensure you describe each with matching style so they feel cohesive, and consider using the “last frame of previous clip as first frame of next” technique if continuity is needed (Veo’s first & last frame feature can help create seamless transitions by generating the intermediate motion between two provided images[56]). If you need a direct cinematic transition (like a fade to black or crossfade), you might have to add that in editing, as text prompts are better at hard cuts or continuous shots than complex fades. That said, you could attempt “camera fades out to black” at the end of a segment, but success may vary.
	•	Pacing: Convey how quickly or slowly things unfold by your wording. Adverbs and adjectives can help: “slowly walks,” “suddenly turns,” “lingers for a moment,” etc. If you want a moment of stillness, mention a hold (e.g. “hold for a 1-second pause on the final frame”[39]). Veo doesn’t let you explicitly set exact durations for each beat (outside the timestamp trick), but phrasing like “quick glimpse” vs “extended look” can influence the outcome. Additionally, audio cues can imply pacing (e.g. rapid heartbeat sound vs. long sustained note). For very tight sync needs (like editing exactly to beats of a music track), you might generate slightly longer and trim afterward, since exact frame-accurate control isn’t guaranteed in-model[57]. But you can nudge it: e.g. “dialogue ends by second 6, then 2s of just ambient music” to hint at timing[58].
	•	Level of Detail: Veo allows for extreme detail if you need it, but be mindful of prompt length. For complex scenes (especially action), you might go into very granular detail to ensure the model includes what you want[59]. The Google DeepMind guide demonstrates an ultra-detailed action prompt describing every moment of an off-road rally in precise terms[60][61] – this can yield an impressive result, but it’s time-consuming to write and might overshoot the time window if not carefully bounded. Use extreme detail only when necessary to get the scene right or if simpler prompts failed to produce the key elements. Often a moderate amount of detail (like our “Precise” example earlier) suffices. If your prompt gets very long, consider if you’re effectively trying to script multiple shots or too many events – if so, breaking it up or using timestamps might be better.
Summary: Describe your scenes like you’re painting a picture for the AI director. One clear idea per clip, richly described, will beat a muddled prompt that tries to do too much at once. And whenever you include multiple subjects or sequential actions, double-check if the prompt might be ambiguous – clarity prevents the AI from merging elements incorrectly.
Audio and Dialogue
One of Veo 3’s standout features is its native audio generation, which can include speech, ambient sounds, and music based on your prompt[1][2]. As a screenwriter using Veo, you should think like a sound designer too: explicitly tell the model what audio to play. Here’s how to incorporate audio effectively:
	•	Dialogue: If you want a character to speak a line, format it clearly. The official docs suggest using quotation marks and attribution, e.g. A woman says, "We have to leave now."[23]. In practice, a safer format is: CharacterName/Description says: "Your dialogue here." and then adding “(no subtitles)” immediately after the line[62]. For example: The man in the red hat says: "Where is the rabbit?" (no subtitles)[63]. Including (no subtitles) is important because the model might otherwise try to visually overlay text as subtitles or create some text artifact when characters speak[62]. This tag tells it not to add any text on screen.
	•	Keep dialogue short and time-appropriate. Remember, with ~8 seconds total, a character can only deliver one brief line clearly. If you cram a whole paragraph of dialogue, Veo will either truncate it or make the speech unnaturally fast (slurred)[64]. A good rule is to use one sentence of dialogue, maybe two short sentences at most, per clip. If you find the spoken line sounds rushed or garbled, you likely have too many syllables; simplify the line and consider adding a direction like “(clear enunciation)” to encourage clarity[64]. Also avoid things that TTS (text-to-speech) struggles with, like spelling out complex numbers or acronyms – unless necessary.
	•	Multiple characters can speak in one prompt, but be careful. It’s best to limit to a brief back-and-forth if you attempt it. Format example for two characters: The man says: "Hello!" The woman replies: "Hi there." (no subtitles). Ensure each line is attributed. Veo 3 can generate multi-person conversations with lip-sync[7], but the more speakers you add, the higher the risk of confusion. For complex dialogues, it may be better to break them into separate clips or use the timestamp method to allocate lines at specific times. Testing is key – always preview how the model handles it.
	•	Sound Effects (SFX): Describe any notable sounds that occur, using a clear label like SFX: or simply weaving it into prose. For example: SFX: thunder cracks in the distance[65] or the door slams with a loud bang. If the sound source is clear from context, you can just say it in narrative form (e.g. “a telephone rings” or “the leaves crunch underfoot”). The key is to include sound cues as part of the prompt so Veo knows to generate those audio elements. Think in terms of layers: what would you hear in this scene? Footsteps, crowd murmur, wind, explosions? List the important ones. If you want to emphasize a sound, call it out explicitly (e.g. “with a sharp gunshot echoing”).
	•	Pro-tip: Indicate relative volume or prominence if needed. For instance: “a faint police siren in the background”, “heavy rainfall sound dominating the audio”, “subtle rustling of papers”. Veo can mix multiple sounds, and by adding adjectives like “faint” or “loud” you guide the mix[66]. If music is present under dialogue, you can say “music under dialogue (keep it soft)” to ensure voices aren’t drowned[66].
	•	Ambient Noise: This is the background soundscape that sets environment. Always consider adding it for realism – even a “silent” scene might have a low ambient hum. Examples: “ambient noise: the quiet hum of a starship bridge”[67], “nighttime crickets and distant traffic”, “café ambiance of clinking cups and chatter”. One line in the prompt like that will prompt Veo to fill the audio background accordingly. It makes a big difference in how polished the video feels. As a rule, don’t neglect audio – silence or missing ambiance can make a scene feel empty, whereas even subtle background sound “glues” the shot together[68].
	•	Music: You can instruct Veo 3 to include music, though you can’t specify an exact known song (it will generate a generic fitting music). Describe the mood and genre of music: “soft piano music,” “intense orchestral score,” “upbeat electronic music,” etc. If you want no music at all, state that: “no background music”. If you do include music, consider if it should start/stop at certain times (you might say “music fades in” or “music ends before the final shot” if needed, though fine control is limited). By default, if you mention nothing, Veo might or might not add music depending on the style it thinks – better to explicitly direct it.
	•	Combining Audio Directions: You can list multiple audio elements in one sentence. A common pattern: “Audio: [describe ambiance], [describe SFX], [describe music].” For example: “Audio: soft wind and distant bird songs; gentle instrumental music in background.” Or embed cues alongside action: “He opens the old door (creaking sound).” Any of these approaches work; just ensure clarity.
	•	Lip Sync and Alignment: Veo 3’s dialogue is lip-synced to the characters it generates[1], which is remarkable. To help it, keep dialogue short as noted, and you might include an emotion tag for delivery (e.g. “she says... [in a weary voice]”[65]). In testing, sometimes adding an adverb or tone (softly, angrily, excitedly) can influence the facial expression or voice tone. As for alignment, you cannot precisely time when within the clip the line is said (except using timestamps). Usually, if there’s one line in an 8s clip, the model will time it somewhere in the middle or beginning. If critical, you can hint: “He says X in the final moment” or “She begins: '...'(line) as scene starts”. But be prepared to adjust via trial and error. Checking the output is important to see if the line fits – the blog suggests testing lip-sync timing if you have multiple lines[69].
	•	Troubleshooting Audio:
	•	If you get unexpected subtitles or text overlay in the video, you likely forgot “(no subtitles)” after spoken lines. Always include that to be safe[62].
	•	If the audio feels empty or too quiet, maybe you didn’t specify enough layers. Fix: add ambient sound and maybe a subtle music or tone to fill space[66]. Veo won’t invent music or noise unless prompted (aside from perhaps generic ambiance). So if something sounds off, add more detail: e.g. “add soft rain sound throughout”, or “low ominous drone in background”. Also ensure your style prompt didn’t unintentionally mute audio (for instance, saying “silent film style” might remove audio).
	•	If the dialogue is too hard to hear due to loud SFX or music, instruct a better mix: e.g. “make music very faint under dialogue” or “thunder claps but not overpowering the speech”.
	•	If using the Veo Fast model (for previewing) via some platforms, note it might have different audio capabilities; always do a final run on the full model for best audio quality once your prompt is settled[70].
In short, think of audio as an integral part of your scene description. Write it as if you’re also the sound engineer: what should the viewer hear to get the full experience? Veo will follow those cues “with remarkable precision” when detailed[71][26]. Many cinematic styles (horror, action, etc.) rely as much on sound as visuals – a horror short with creaking floors and whispering wind, or an action clip with booming engines and impact sounds – so include those elements in your prompt to elevate the output from just an animated storyboard to a full audiovisual clip.
Prompt Engineering Best Practices and Troubleshooting
Writing effective Veo 3 prompts is part art and part science. Here we compile best practices, common pitfalls, and tips for troubleshooting issues. Following these guidelines will save time and yield more reliable results:
General Best Practices
	•	Be Clear and Specific: Ambiguity is the enemy. Describe who, what, where, when, and how for each scene. Use unambiguous language and avoid double meanings. Instead of “make it dramatic,” specify what makes it dramatic (camera angle, lighting, etc.)[27]. If you mean “no people in scene,” say “an empty landscape with no figures” rather than “no people” (the latter might confuse the AI).
	•	Use Cinematic Terms the Model Knows: Leverage the film vocabulary we discussed – camera shots, angles, lighting styles, etc. Veo is trained on such descriptions, and using them gives you finer control[28]. For instance, “tracking shot” or “Dutch angle” might yield exactly that style in the output. When in doubt, simple terms like close-up, wide shot, pan, etc., are very effective[17].
	•	Structure Your Prompt in Slots: As noted, include subject, action, setting, style, camera, lighting, audio in a logical order. This helps ensure you haven’t missed anything. A consistent slot-based approach (even mentally or in how you write) leads to fewer omissions[72][73].
	•	Keep Prompts Concise but Rich: There’s no strict token limit given to users, but a prompt that’s too long could start to confuse or over-constrain the model. Aim for roughly 3–6 concise sentences or phrase clauses covering the key elements[74]. You can use commas or semicolons to stack details in a sentence (as in our examples). If you find yourself writing a whole novel, consider splitting the scene.
	•	One Scene per Prompt: Don’t try to have the AI show you two unrelated locations or times in a single 8-second generation (unless you use timestamps). It’s best for one coherent scene or sequence. Jumping around will usually fail or produce incoherent blending[75]. For multiple scenes, do multiple prompts/clips.
	•	Leverage Example Prompts: Starting from proven prompts can help. Google’s docs and community resources (like the examples we cited) give a sense of what phrasing works. You can adapt a template instead of starting from scratch each time. For instance, you might keep a “dialogue scene template” or an “action scene template” and just fill in your specifics. (We provided some templates in the next section.)
	•	Test Iteratively: Treat your first generation as a draft. Evaluate what’s off (maybe the lighting was wrong, or the character wasn’t as described) and refine the prompt. Change only a few things at a time so you know what fix caused what effect[70]. For example, if the scene was too dark and the camera moved when you wanted it still, you might add “soft fill light” and “locked tripod shot” in the next try. By iterating, you converge on the desired result without wasting too many credits. Using the faster/low-quality preview model (if available) for these iterations can save time[76].
	•	For 9:16 Vertical Videos: Explicitly mention that aspect ratio or framing needs. E.g. “portrait 9:16 frame, full-body view of subject”. The older Veo 3 model didn’t support 9:16, but Veo 3.1 does support vertical[6]. Still, it’s wise to tell the AI if you want a vertical composition (and note that very wide lateral camera moves might not make sense in 9:16, so possibly reduce panning for vertical as one guide suggests[77]).
Common Issues & Fixes
Here are frequent issues and how to troubleshoot them, as documented by experts[78][64]:
	•	Dialogue is rushed or slurred: The character’s speech sounds too fast or unintelligible.Cause: Too much dialogue text for the clip’s duration (trying to cram maybe ~4+ seconds of speech into 2 seconds).Fix: Shorten the line. Use simpler words, fewer syllables[64]. If needed, split dialogue into two clips. Add a note like “(clear enunciation)” which can help. Ensure you’re not including multiple sentences where one would do.
	•	Unwanted subtitles appear: You see text captions in the video without asking for them.Cause: The model inferred it should add subtitles for the spoken line (it sometimes does for clarity, especially if style hints like “movie scene” might trigger it).Fix: Always append “(no subtitles)” after dialogue in the prompt[62]. This explicitly tells Veo not to render any text for dialogue. That should eliminate surprise captions.
	•	Audio feels empty or missing: The video has little or no sound, or important sounds are absent.Cause: Prompt didn’t specify ambient sound or music, so Veo might only do minimal audio.Fix: Specify each layer of audio you expect[66]. Add ambient noises, SFX, or music cues into the prompt. For example, “Audio: low wind and distant cars, soft piano music in background”. If an effect is too quiet, describe it as louder; if the whole scene is too quiet, add a general ambiance. It’s about painting a full soundscape in text.
	•	Style/Look varies between takes or shots: If you generate multiple clips and they look inconsistent (e.g. character’s outfit changes, color grading differs).Cause: You described them slightly differently, or left out details in one of the prompts.Fix: Copy-paste the same style and character descriptors across prompts for related shots[42]. Re-declare key details every time: wardrobe, accessories, time of day, etc., should be repeated to the model if you want them persistent. Consistency in prompts yields consistency in output.
	•	Camera moves unintentionally: You expected a still shot but the output had some pan or drift.Cause: No instruction to keep camera static – the model might add slight movement on its own.Fix: Add a stability cue: e.g. “Locked-off camera, no movement” or “steady tripod shot”[36]. By explicitly saying the camera is fixed, you can prevent unwanted motion.
	•	Lighting doesn’t match the intended mood or description: Perhaps you wanted a dark scene but it came out too bright, or vice versa.Cause: The prompt’s lighting description was vague or omitted.Fix: Be more explicit with lighting terms[46]. For instance, if it’s meant to be dark and moody, mention low light, shadows, etc. Conversely, if you expected bright, specify “bright sunlight” or additional light sources. Also check if any other part of your prompt implied a different lighting (for example, saying “professional studio” might default to bright lighting). Align every element with the mood – and explicitly stating the mood (gloomy, cheerful) can serve as a tiebreaker for the AI’s interpretation.
	•	Action appears unnatural or physics are off: Maybe motions look weird (e.g. an object floating when it shouldn’t).Cause: Lack of physics context in prompt. The model isn’t perfect at physics, but prompting can help.Fix: Describe the physical interactions or forces at play[48]. E.g. “heavy object falls with weight – a thud as it hits ground”, or “wind blows through her hair”, “gravity makes the jump arc down realistically”. Including these cues gives the AI hints to follow real-world physics. Also avoid contradicting physics in your prompt (don’t accidentally describe something impossible unless you intend a surreal effect).
	•	Clip feels too short for the idea: Your concept might really need 15 seconds but Veo only gave 8, so everything feels rushed.Cause: Over-scoping – trying to fit too many beats into one clip[51].Fix: Simplify the scene to one main beat or split into multiple clips. Focus on one “moment” per 4–8s[75]. For example, instead of showing an entire car chase in one go, focus on one highlight of it (like the car jumping over a gap). You can always create another clip for the next beat. Planning with the 8s limitation in mind is crucial. If absolutely needed, use the timestamp approach to delineate segments, but remember that each segment still shares the total time.
	•	Multiple subjects or complex scene gets jumbled: e.g. two characters might merge or the background might misplace elements.Cause: Possibly prompt confusion – maybe you listed many elements without clear relationships.Fix: Use clear syntax and maybe break into sentences. For example, rather than “John and Mary stand in a kitchen and he holds a cup while she looks outside”, consider splitting: “John stands in the kitchen holding a cup of coffee. Mary stands beside him, gazing out the window.” Also ensure adjectives clearly attach to the right noun (if you say “small child near the tall tree” it’s clear; but “small tree near the tall man” vs “tall tree near the small man” – word order matters to avoid confusion). If a particular element tends to get lost, try giving it a separate sentence or more emphasis.
Pitfalls to Avoid
	•	Overloading the Story: Don’t attempt to compress a whole movie’s plot into one prompt. “Overpacked stories: Don’t ask for three locations, two character arcs, and a twist in 8 seconds. Pick one moment; make it rich.”[75]. This insight from experts reminds us to narrow the scope. The best AI videos focus on a single compelling moment or visual beat – which is perfect for TikTok/Shorts where brevity is key. Save complex narratives for multiple shots or a series of prompts.
	•	Generic Adjectives Without Details: Simply saying “make it cinematic” or “epic scene” without specifics won’t yield consistently cinematic results[27]. Instead of vague terms, use the concrete tools we have: specify camera angles, lens, lighting, etc. For example, rather than “epic battle scene,” prompt with the elements that make it epic: “Wide shot of two armies clashing at dusk, camera shaking from explosions, fiery orange sky”, etc. Always replace empty descriptors with tangible details.
	•	Neglecting Audio and Atmosphere: As mentioned, an otherwise great visual can fall flat with no sound. Avoid leaving audio blank unless silence is a deliberate choice for effect. Even a quiet scene may benefit from a soft ambient tone or environmental noise. Don’t write prompts as if you’re only describing a static image – remember it’s a video with sound. So include the dimension of time (movement) and audio in your description.
	•	Not Specifying the Frame/Format: If you have a target format (like vertical vs horizontal), mention it. Also, consider the frame composition – for example, if generating widescreen (16:9), think about how to fill that frame (lots of horizontal detail), whereas for vertical, emphasize vertical elements (tall buildings, full body of a person, etc.)[79]. If you assume incorrectly, you might get a composition that isn’t optimal (like a subject cut off in a vertical view). So include aspect ratio or orientation cues if needed (some interfaces let you choose 9:16 explicitly; if not, mention it in text).
	•	Changing Too Many Things at Once when Iterating: If an output isn’t right and you go back to edit the prompt, don’t rewrite everything in one go. That makes it hard to learn which change fixed or caused what. Instead, tweak gradually – one guide suggests “iterate with surgical edits so you can attribute changes to outcomes”[80]. For example, first fix the camera angle, test, then fix the lighting, test, etc., unless you already know exactly what to change. This approach will help you build a prompt library of effective patterns (since you can see which prompt phrasing gave good results)[76][81].
By following these best practices and avoiding common pitfalls, you’ll significantly improve your success rate with Veo 3. Prompt engineering for AI video is a learning process – even professionals iterate and refine. The good news is that Veo 3, with its latest updates, is quite responsive to well-crafted prompts, enabling a level of creative control that was impossible in earlier generative models[4]. Treat each prompt like a set of director’s instructions and, when things go wrong, use the above troubleshooting tips to diagnose and fix the issue.
Cinematic Style Templates and Examples
Every genre or video style has its own “language” – particular shot styles, lighting, and pacing that define it. Below are prompt patterns and mini-templates for various cinematic styles relevant to short-form videos. These can be starting points (you’d fill in specifics for your scene) to ensure you hit the right tone. Each includes a short example prompt snippet illustrating how to invoke that style.
	•	Film Noir: Embrace high-contrast black-and-white visuals, dramatic shadow and light interplay, and a mysterious mood. Typically features low-key lighting (with deep shadows) and often a 1940s urban setting. Example prompt: “Film noir style, a man in a fedora and trench coat walks under a flickering streetlamp at midnight, black and white, heavy shadows. Smoke drifts in alley. Low-angle shot to make him look imposing. A distant saxophone plays a bluesy tune.” This would yield a noir look with monochrome palette and strong chiaroscuro. (If using color, you might still say “monochrome” or “muted tones” to get the noir vibe.) – Note: For noir, explicitly mentioning black-and-white is key. As a simpler example from documentation: “Film noir style, man and woman walk on the street, mystery, cinematic, black and white.”[82] which clearly triggers a beautiful noir aesthetic (often the model will add that classic contrast and shadowing when it sees “film noir”).
	•	Documentary: Aim for a realistic, unpolished feel, as if a camera operator is capturing real life. Use handheld camera or POV, natural lighting, and minimal dramatic effects. The tone should be authentic and un-stylized. Example prompt: “Documentary-style: A wildlife researcher hikes through dense forest. Handheld camera follows from behind, slightly shaky. Natural light filtering through trees, no color grading – looks realistic. She speaks quietly: ‘We’ve been tracking the wolves for hours...’ (no subtitles). Ambient sound: rustling leaves, distant bird calls, no music.” This prompt yields a very natural-looking scene without the glossy cinematic color grading; the handheld cue adds to the realism[83][84]. For documentary, also consider using longer continuous shots and avoid theatrical camera moves – think observer perspective. If it’s interview-style (a subset of documentary), see the interview template below.
	•	Action (High-Octane): Emphasize speed, motion, and excitement. Quick cuts or continuous chaotic movement. Use terms like fast-paced, shaky cam, dynamic angles, slow-motion (for highlights) if needed, etc. Lighting may be high-contrast or flickering (explosions, streaks of light), and audio will include impactful SFX. Example prompt: “Action movie style: A car chase through narrow streets. Camera shakes and swings rapidly to follow the speeding cars (mounted dash-cam feel). Quick cuts between close-ups of the driver’s determined eyes and wide shots of cars drifting around corners. Intense lighting – headlights streak and neon signs blur. SFX: screeching tires, roaring engines, crash sounds. Adrenaline-pumping music builds tension.” This describes an archetypal action scene. Veo will try to deliver on the motion and chaos. In an 8s clip, you might not fit many cuts, so possibly focus on one segment (or use timestamp segments for multiple angles). Another angle: mention “found-footage or embedded documentary aesthetic” for action to get that frenetic camera, as shown in DeepMind’s example of an off-road rally where “the camera is often shaky, as if held by a daring spectator… capturing the raw, unpredictable energy of the race”[35]. That language can help convey the untamed motion of action scenes. The key is to highlight movement and impact in every line (fast moves, things happening, loud sounds). Also consider slow-motion for a dramatic effect (like an explosion in slow-mo). If you need that, specify “in slow motion” for that moment or use 60 FPS mode if available (though default is 24 FPS cinematic look).
	•	Comedy: For comedic videos, the visuals often involve timing and contrast. Bright, even lighting is common (unless it’s a very dry or dark comedy), as comedy usually isn’t hiding things in shadow. Colors might be vibrant or at least not dull. Camera work can be straightforward – static shots that let the humor play out, or deliberate zooms for comedic effect (think of mockumentary zoom-ins on faces). Example prompt: “Comedy skit style: A pet golden retriever wearing sunglasses sits at a café table with a laptop, pretending to type with its paws. Handheld camera captures the absurd scene naturally, slight wobble as if a friend is filming on a phone. Passersby in the background do double-takes. Bright, daytime lighting, colors are warm and cheerful. Audio: lighthearted ukulele music, café ambient chatter, maybe a cartoonish ‘ding’ when the dog hits “Enter”.” This prompt sets a funny, viral-style scene (indeed based on a social content example)[85]. The humor comes from the absurd subject (dog with laptop) and the prompt’s tone is upbeat. In general for comedy, you can explicitly say “humorous tone” or “playful mood”, and include any comedic beats (like a character slipping on a banana peel, with a “boing” sound effect – yes, you can direct even that!). Keep camera fairly neutral unless a comedic zoom or angle adds to the joke. Many comedy shorts mimic documentary (for deadpan humor) or use very centered framing for a Wes Anderson-esque quirky look. Adjust style to the type of comedy (slapstick vs dry humor). The audio often carries comedic timing too – e.g., an awkward silence, or a punchline delivered with a sudden sound. You can cue those: “(beat of silence)”, “rimshot sound effect” if doing a jokey bit, etc.
	•	Interview-Style (Talking Head): This is typically a person speaking to camera, as you’d see in documentaries, news, or YouTube interviews. Keep it simple and professional. Template:[86]“[Character description] sits in [setting]. Medium shot with [camera behavior]. [Character] looks into camera and says: [dialogue]. Warm, professional lighting. Audio: clear speech, subtle [background sound]. No subtitles.”[86].For example: “A well-dressed young woman sits in a modern office conference room. Medium static shot at eye-level. She looks into the camera and says: "Our company’s mission is to innovate." Soft, professional lighting (no harsh shadows). Audio: her voice is clear; faint office background hum, no music. (No subtitles.)” This would produce a very standard interview clip – like a CEO on camera. The key elements are: medium shot, direct-to-camera eye contact, clean lighting, and minimal distractions. Always include “no subtitles” after the speech to avoid any captions. If you want the classic off-camera interviewer effect, you could have the subject look slightly off camera and not speak directly to viewer (and maybe prompt an interviewer’s question off-screen). For instance: “Interviewer (off-camera) asks: 'How did you start?' The woman responds: 'Honestly, in my garage...'” But keep it brief.
	•	Music Video: This style is more about visual flair and rhythm. Think bold lighting, potentially surreal or artistic visuals, dynamic camera moves, and of course an audio focus on music. Since Veo can’t use a specific song you provide (it will generate its own music), you describe the vibe of the music. Example prompt: “Music video aesthetic: A singer in a glittering outfit performs on a stage of colorful lights. Dynamic cuts – camera switches from a wide shot of the whole stage to close-ups of the singer’s face and the guitarist’s hands strumming, in sync with the beat. Vibrant neon colors and laser lights sweeping through smoke. Fast-paced editing, maybe a quick zoom or spin around the singer during the chorus. Audio: upbeat pop music with a strong beat, the singer’s voice echoing slightly. Crowd cheers in the background.” This prompt tries to capture the essence of a pop music video: energetic visuals and movement tied to music[84]. For different genres, adjust style: e.g. “gritty rock music video in a warehouse, handheld camera” or “smooth R&B music video with slow-motion, moody lighting”. Always mention “Music:” and describe the style (rock, EDM, classical, etc.), and any specific audio features (heavy bass, solo piano, etc.). If you want the visuals to cut on beats, you might need to experiment with timestamping segments to match a 4/4 rhythm for example (though that’s advanced). Also note that Veo can generate people singing with lip-sync if you give them lyrics to sing (the dialogue system) – e.g. The singer on stage sings: "When you look me in the eyes, I can see a million stars." (no subtitles) as in Google’s example[87]. The model will attempt to make the character’s mouth move to those lyrics in time. That’s a powerful feature for music video-like prompts. Use it sparingly (short lyrics line) and test the timing.
	•	Others (Stylistic References): You can guide style by referencing known directors or techniques:
	•	“Wes Anderson style – symmetrical framing, pastel colors, whimsical tone.” This will cue the model to mimic that aesthetic (centered shots, etc.).
	•	“Horror film style – tilted angles, flickering lighting (like lightning flashes), deep shadows, and tense atmosphere.” With audio of eerie music and whispers perhaps.
	•	“Animated cartoon style – bright colors, exaggerated physics, cell-shaded look.” Veo might lean into a more CGI/animated appearance if prompted.
	•	“Silent-era film style – grainy, high-contrast black-and-white, title cards (if any dialogue), piano music.” (Though caution: if you don’t want any text, again specify no subtitles/title cards).
	•	“Documentary newsreel 1980s – slightly grainy footage, dated colors, static camera.”
	•	“VR first-person style – POV shots, wide FOV lens, immersive audio.”
Essentially, you can add “in the style of X” or “like a [genre] film”, and provide the specific markers of that style[88][89]. The model is surprisingly adept at genre mimicry when given the right cues. Just ensure you also describe the actual content of your scene around those cues.
Fill-in Prompt Templates
To recap and provide ready-to-use structures, here are a few fill-in templates you can adapt (based on common scenarios)[90][91]:
	•	Product Teaser (Studio Setting): “A [product] sits/rotates on a [surface/background]. [Shot framing & camera move] (e.g. Macro close-up at 85mm; slow smooth dolly-in). [Lighting description] (e.g. Edge lighting: cool blue rim from behind; soft white key from right; faint haze to reveal light beams). [Additional detail] (e.g. dust motes drift in the light). Audio: [music style] (e.g. low pulsing synth) and [SFX] (e.g. subtle mechanical whir). No dialogue, no subtitles. End with [desired closing shot] (e.g. hold on a logo for 1s).” – This template is great for showcase videos of objects or gadgets[39][92].
	•	Outdoor Lifestyle (Action + Ambience): “[Subjects] [action] in [setting]. [Wide or Medium shot] with [camera movement/lens] (e.g. wide establishing shot, then gentle pan tracking left; 35mm lens). [Lighting] (e.g. warm key from low sun, soft shadows). [Ambient SFX] (e.g. wind ruffles hair; waves crash softly; footsteps thud). One says: “[short dialogue]” (no subtitles). [Camera note] (e.g. keep the camera stable or follow smoothly).” – For example: “Two friends jog at golden hour along a coastal boardwalk. Wide shot, then pan tracking them from behind; 35mm lens. Warm low sunlight, long soft shadows. Wind ruffles their hair; waves crash softly nearby; their sneakers thud on wood. One says: ‘Almost there!’ (no subtitles). Camera remains steady as it follows.”[91][93].
	•	Educational Explainer (Dialogue-Focused): “[Person] stands/sits [location], [shot framing] (e.g. medium shot at 50mm). [Lighting condition] (e.g. even, neutral lighting; minimal shadows). [Camera behavior] (e.g. gentle lock-off, no movement). Dialogue: [what they say] (no subtitles). Audio: [ambient] (e.g. faint room tone) and [background music] (e.g. soft instrumental pad under dialogue). [Closing action] (e.g. end on a 1-second hold of the final frame).” – For example: “A calm teacher stands by a whiteboard in a bright classroom, medium shot at 50mm. Even, neutral lighting; gentle camera lock-off (steady shot). She says: ‘Welcome to our quick lesson on ecosystems’ (no subtitles). Ambient classroom hum; a soft piano melody underlines the dialogue. End with a 1-second hold on her smile.”[94][95].
	•	Atmospheric Mood Piece: “[Setting description]. [Shot framing and motion] (e.g. wide static shot, 24 fps filmic motion). [Key environmental details in motion] (e.g. raindrops ripple in puddles; neon signs flicker). [Color palette and lighting] (e.g. Cool blue palette with occasional magenta accents; soft foggy glow). Ambient audio: [environmental sounds] (e.g. distant traffic, soft rain, occasional footsteps); [music] if any (e.g. no music or a very faint ambient tone). No dialogue.” – For example: “Night rain over a neon-lit street in Osaka. Wide, static shot at 24fps; raindrops ripple in puddles; steam drifts from a street vent. Cool-blue palette with magenta neon accents reflecting on wet asphalt. Ambient sound of rain and distant traffic; no dialogue. Add a subtle film grain for texture.”[96][97]. This kind of prompt creates a vibe rather than action – useful for B-roll or transitions, or just artsy atmospheric clips.
	•	Slow-Motion Detail (Food/Artistic): “[Describe a close-up action in slow motion]. [Lens details] (e.g. Macro at 100mm; very shallow depth of field). [Lighting] (e.g. warm, directional key light from left; soft highlights, some bloom). Audio: [matching SFX] (e.g. rich slow-motion sound of the action), [ambient/mood] (e.g. faint background café murmur), no music (or music) as desired, no dialogue.” – For example: “Slow-motion pour of glossy dark chocolate syrup over a stack of pancakes. Macro lens, very shallow depth; camera pushes in slightly to follow the pour. Warm directional key from left; highlights gleam and bloom softly on the syrup. Audio: rich thick pouring sound, maybe a subtle yum from someone off-screen; faint café murmur in background; no music, no dialogue.”[98][99]. This template works for any sensual detail shot (food, slow-mo nature, product macro).
Feel free to tweak these templates for your needs. The idea is they already embody the structured approach and contain many of the elements we discussed, so you can fill in the blanks with your specific subject and get a solid result.
