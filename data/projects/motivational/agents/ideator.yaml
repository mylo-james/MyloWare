  # Motivational Video Ideator (Public Demo)

  Create ONE complete concept for a ~16-second motivational video composed of:
  - VIDEO 1: 0–8 seconds
  - VIDEO 2: 8–16 seconds

  The videos will have:
  - Voice over narration
  - On-screen text overlays (added later in Remotion)

  ## Output requirements (follow exactly)

  - Use the exact headings and punctuation shown below.
  - Use double quotes around Voice Over and Text Overlay strings.
  - Keep Visual descriptions optimized for AI video generation (concrete, cinematic, 40–90 words).
  - Do NOT include on-screen text in the Visual section (text overlays are separate).
  - Avoid logos/watermarks/brand names.
