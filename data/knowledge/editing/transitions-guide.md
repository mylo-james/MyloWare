### Match Cut

**Duration**: 0.3-1 second typical

### Dissolve/Cross-Fade

## When to Cut

### Cut on Action

Cut during movement, not before or after.

**Why**: Viewer's eye follows the motion, hiding the cut

**Examples**:
- Cut as hand moves -> catches object
- Cut during head turn
- Cut at moment of impact

### Cut on Beat

Time cuts to music beats or rhythm.

**Why**: Feels satisfying, professional

**How**:
- Identify strong beats in audio
- Place cuts on those beats
- Vary between every beat, every other beat

### Cut on Emotion

Change shot when emotion shifts.

**Why**: Emphasizes the emotional beat

**Examples**:
- Cut to reaction after reveal
- Cut to close-up at emotional peak
- Cut away during uncomfortable moment

## Transition Pace

### By Content Type

| Tutorial | Medium | Hard cuts, occasional dissolves |
| Comedy | Fast | Hard cuts, jump cuts |
| Story | Variable | Match to emotional rhythm |
| Hype/Energy | Very fast | Hard cuts on beats |

### Cut Frequency Guidelines

| Pace | Cuts Per Minute | Feel |
|------|-----------------|------|
| Slow | 5-10 | Relaxing, meditative |
| Medium | 15-25 | Normal, comfortable |

## Transition Mistakes

### What to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too many transition effects | Distracting, unprofessional | Default to hard cuts |
| Cutting mid-word | Jarring, confusing | Cut between sentences |
| Random transitions | No visual logic | Consistent style |
| Too slow | Loses attention | Match content energy |
| Too fast for content | Can't process | Let shots breathe |
| Star wipes, etc. | Dated, cheesy | Use sparingly if ever |

### Transition Effect Overuse

> When in doubt, use a hard cut.
>
> Effects should serve the story, not show off editing.

## Transitions for AI Video

### AI-Generated Scene Changes

When prompting for multi-scene AI video:

```
Scene 1: [description]
Transition: Cut to
Scene 2: [description]
```

### Continuity Across Scenes

For smooth AI transitions:
- Match lighting descriptions
- Keep subject consistent
- Use similar framing
- Consider "match cut" language

**Example**:
```
Scene 1: Close-up of glass apple from front, soft lighting
Scene 2: Close-up of glass apple from side, same lighting
```

## Audio Transitions

### Sound Bridges

Use audio to smooth visual transitions:

| Technique | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Music continuous** | Connects scenes |
| **Sound effect** | Punctuates transition |
| **Audio fade** | Softens scene change |
| **Room tone match** | Hides the cut |

### When Audio Matters

- ASMR: Audio transitions critical
- Music videos: Cut to beat
- Dialogue: J-cuts and L-cuts
- Action: Sound effects on cuts
