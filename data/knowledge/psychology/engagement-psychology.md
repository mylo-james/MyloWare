## What Triggers Comments

### Questions and Prompts

Direct questions guide viewers on what to say:
- "Which one would you choose?"
- "Anyone else relate?"
- "What would you do?"

### Calls to Action

Explicit instructions people follow if they enjoyed content:
- "Comment your favorite emoji"
- "Tell us your story below"
- "Drop a 🔥 if you agree"

### Relatability

When content mirrors viewer experiences:
- "Same!" responses flood in
- "Tell me you're ___ without telling me" trends
- Authentic, imperfect content = "just like me" feeling

### Emotional Reactions

Strong emotions drive expression:

| Emotion | Comment Type |
|---------|--------------|
| Laughter | "I can't stop laughing" + friend tags |
| Shock | "I'm crying" / "this gave me chills" |
| Awe | "How is this possible?" |
| Anger | Debates and disagreements |

### Light Controversy

Low-stakes debates ignite comments:
- "Pineapple on pizza - yes or no?"
- Either/or dilemmas
- Opinion-splits (fun, not divisive)

### Community / Inside Jokes

Viewers comment to signal belonging:
- "IYKYK" (if you know, you know)
- Fanbase nicknames
- Meme references

### Creator Engagement

When creators reply, it motivates more comments:
- Reply to comments (by name)
- Video responses to specific comments
- Like or pin comments
- Acknowledge questions

### Social Proof

Busy comment sections attract more:
> "Everyone is talking about this" -> join in

## What Drives Shares

### Humor and Entertainment

Funny videos = most shared content.
- Comedy skits, pranks, memes
- "I need to spread this laugh"

### Shock / "Wow" Factor

Surprise or awe triggers sharing impulse:
- Stunning visuals
- Unbelievable tricks
- Plot twist endings
- "Others MUST see this"

### Usefulness / Learning

Practical value gets passed along:
- Tips, hacks, tutorials
- "This is so useful!"
- Makes sharer look resourceful

### Heartwarming / Inspirational

### Relatability as Self-Expression

Videos that "say what I can't":
- Share = communicate sentiment
- "So us" culture

### Beauty / Aesthetics

Visual pleasure drives sharing:
- Stunning landscapes
- Satisfying processes
- ASMR visuals

### Explicit Share Prompts

Direct triggers plant the idea:
- "Share this with someone who needs to hear it"
- "Tag a friend who would laugh"
- "Send this to the clumsiest person you know"

### FOMO (Trend Participation)

Trending challenges = high shareability:
- "Everyone's doing it"
- Don't want to be left out

## Curiosity as Engagement Lever

### Curiosity Gap Hook

Start with intrigue, delay resolution:
- "You won't believe what I found..."
- Build suspense
- Algorithm rewards watch time

### "Wait for It" Endings

- Hint payoff is coming
- Viewers rewatch, tag friends
- Cut-off endings -> "Need part 2!" comments

### Open-Ended Questions

- Leave mystery or detail omitted
- Comments speculate or ask
- Outsource resolution to audience

### Teasers for Future Content

"I'll reveal the secret in the next video"
- Drives follows
- Saves as reminders
- Comment guesses

### Balance Required

Too many cliffhangers without payoff -> frustration.

## ASMR Engagement Factors

### Sensory Appeal

- Triggers release dopamine/serotonin
- Physical pleasure hooks viewers
- Interrupts scrolling behavior

### Calming vs Stimulating

| Type | Engagement Style |
|------|------------------|
| Calming (whispers, slow) | Long watch, repeats, "fell asleep" comments |
| Stimulating (crunch, fast tap) | Surprise, shares, "this trigger is new!" |

### High Engagement Metrics

ASMR drives deep (not surface) engagement:
- Full video watches
- Multiple replays
- Saves for later listening
- Comments on sensation felt

### Parasocial Comfort

- Intimate nature creates bond
- Feeling of being cared for
- Loyal followership
- Regular commenters, inside jokes

### Community Dynamics

- Specific hashtags (#asmr, #tingles)
- Fans tag each other
- Request-based content
- Collaborative trigger trends

## AI Content Engagement Factors

### Novelty Advantage

- Unusual/cutting-edge grabs attention
- Algorithm doesn't discriminate by origin
- Curiosity drives initial watch time

### Surface vs Deep Engagement

| Metric | AI Performance |
|--------|----------------|
| Views, likes, shares | ~6% higher |
| First-second retention | Strong |
| Comments, emotional connection | Weaker |
| Follower loyalty | Lower |

> AI excels at surface engagement, struggles with deep connection.

### What Works

- Aesthetic/creative appeal (wow factor)
- Interactive trends (AI filters everyone tries)
- Hybrid: AI visuals + human narrator/reaction

### Trust Issues

- Skepticism toward AI personas
- "Content fatigue" with generic outputs
- Viewers value authenticity

### Best Practice: Hybrid Approach

AI for:
- Spectacular visuals
- Production efficiency
- Novel effects

Human for:
- Explanation/reaction
