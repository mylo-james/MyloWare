## Why Hooks Matter

- 50-70% of viewers drop if not hooked within 3 seconds
- The first second decides whether a new viewer stays

## Hook Categories

### Visual Shock / Surprise

**What**: Striking or unexpected visual that freezes the thumb

**Examples**:
- Extreme close-up of unusual object
- Bizarre scene or out-of-place element
- Dramatic before/after split screen

**Why it works**: Surprise releases dopamine, triggers "wait, what?"

### Curiosity / Questions

**What**: Question or riddle creating a curiosity gap

**Examples**:
- "Ever wonder why your videos get 0 views?"
- "Wait for it - you'll be surprised"
- Text overlay with intriguing question

**Why it works**: Open loop that only watching can close

### Bold / Controversial Statement

**What**: Strong claim or hot take that demands justification

**Examples**:
- "TikTok hashtags are killing your reach"
- "Everyone is doing this wrong"
- Polarizing opinion that sparks debate

**Why it works**: Viewers stay to see proof or argue

### Show End Result First

**What**: Reveal the "after" upfront, then explain how

**Examples**:
- Final cool effect shown first
- Transformation result before process
- Achievement before journey

**Why it works**: Viewers want to know how it happened

### Direct Address

**What**: Call out viewer or specific group

**Examples**:
- "Hey small business owners, you need to hear this"

### Numbers / Stats

**What**: Shocking statistic or number

**Examples**:
- "Only 2% of creators do this..."
- "I made $10K in 3 days with this"

### Relatable Humor / Emotion

**What**: Instantly recognizable scenario or feeling

**Examples**:
- "POV: You open TikTok for 5 minutes... 2 hours later"
- Universal frustration expressed
- Genuine emotional reaction

**Why it works**: Instant empathy or laughter

### Challenge / Dare

**What**: Psychological trigger to prove something

## Visual Hook Tactics

### First-Second Essentials

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with motion | Start static |
| Show action mid-progress | Fade from black |
| Use unusual angles | Begin with logo/intro |
| High contrast colors | Slow ease-in |

### Motion Techniques

- Quick zoom in/out
- Sudden camera pan
- Jump cuts
- Start mid-action (no setup)

### Attention-Grabbing Visuals

| Technique | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Extreme close-up | "What is that?" curiosity |
| Unusual angle | Pattern interrupt |
| Bold color splash | Visual exclamation |
| Object out of place | Triggers investigation |
| Split screen comparison | Instant story |

### Text as Visual Element

- Large, bold text from frame 1
- "❗" or "WARNING" or "OMG"
- Contrasting colors that pop
- Emoji to draw eye

---

## Text Overlay Best Practices

### Timing

- Appear within 0-2 seconds
- Don't wait--hook text shows immediately

### Formatting

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| < 100 characters | Quick readability |
| Big, readable font | Mobile viewing |
| High contrast colors | Visibility |
| Upper-center placement | Avoid UI overlap |

### Effective Hook Text

```
[x] "Watch this"
[x] "3 Tips in 30s"
[x] "Don't scroll!"
[x] "[Question about viewer's problem]"

[ ] Long paragraphs
[ ] Tiny font
[ ] Bottom of screen (UI covers it)
```

### Text + Audio Synergy

Don't duplicate exactly--complement:
- Spoken: "I nearly quit my job over this"
- Text: "I almost WALKED OUT 😳"

### Silent Viewer Strategy

Front-load info in text for sound-off scrollers.

For ASMR/sound content: "🔊 Sound on for tingles"

---

## Audio Hook Tactics

### Voice Hooks

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Jump into provocative statement | "Hey guys, today I'll..." |
| Use urgent/compelling tone | Slow warm-up |
| First line = hook | Waste first seconds on intro |

**Examples**:
- "Stop scrolling - you need to hear this"
- "Quick productivity hack: ..."
- Whispered "listen to this..."

### Sound Effects

- "Pop", "ding", record scratch
- Sonic exclamation marks
- Timed to visual transitions
- 0.3s silence -> burst of sound (contrast)

### Music Hooks

- Cut to song hook immediately (no long intro)
- Sync beat "drop" with first visual
- Use trending sounds (recognition boost)

### Silence as Hook

"Silent Shock" format:
- Brief silence with odd visuals
- Stands out in noisy feed
- Audio comes in after pause

### ASMR Audio Hooks

Deliver trigger sound instantly:
- Gentle tapping
- Crisp crinkling
- Soft whisper greeting
- Satisfying crunch

---

## Pattern Interrupt Techniques

### What They Are

Deliberate disruptions that break autopilot scrolling.

> Our brains notice anomalies and force attention.

### Types of Interrupts

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Sudden scene change | Calm -> chaotic in 0.5s |
| Mid-story start | "...and that's how I ended up here" |
| Visual anomaly | Unexpected prop, glitch effect |
| Rhythm break | Fast-fast-slow pacing |
| Tone contrast | Somber -> cheerful cut |

### Frequency

- Critical: First 1-3 seconds
- Maintenance: Mini-interrupt every 3-5 seconds throughout

---

## The 3-Hook Structure

### Layer Multiple Hooks

**Second 0-1**: Visual hook (captivating image/action)

**Second 1-2**: Audio hook (statement or sound cue)

**Second 2-3**: Text hook (question, statement, promise)

### Example: Cleaning Hack Video

| Time | Hook Type | Content |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 0s | Visual | Filthy shirt next to clean shirt |
| 1s | Audio | "Don't throw out your old clothes yet!" |
| 2s | Text | "Stop tossing money on new clothes" |

By second 3: Viewer knows value and is intrigued.

## ASMR-Specific Hooks

### Key Difference

Trade intensity for intimacy and intrigue.

### ASMR Hook Tactics

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Trigger immediately | Tapping/scratching from frame 1 |
| Mood-setting text | "Relax with me 😴" |
| Satisfying visual focus | Close-up of aesthetic object |
| Whispered greeting | Soft "hi, I'm glad you're here" |
| Satisfying action loop | Perfect cut of kinetic sand |

### ASMR Hook Don'ts

```
[ ] Jarring visuals
[ ] Loud noises
[ ] Bright flashes
[ ] Aggressive hooks
```

### ASMR Hook Goal

Signal "tingles start now" within 1 second.

Even non-ASMR viewers may be lured by "oddly satisfying" quality.

## AI Content-Specific Hooks

### Leverage the Novelty

AI content has built-in curiosity factor--lean into it.

### AI Hook Tactics

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Show striking AI visual first | Most bizarre/beautiful output |
| Flag AI in text | "This image was 100% AI-generated 😳" |
| Challenge reality | "This person does not exist" |
| Promise insight | "Learn the AI trick behind this art" |
| Tap trending AI topics | "When AI takes over your Zoom..." |

### Effective AI Hook Formats

```
"POV: AI is going crazy"
"I let an AI run my life for 24 hours"
"This video isn't real - an AI made it"
"AI vs Human - can you tell which?"
```

### Visual Signals

- Glitch effects, code overlays
- Sci-fi elements in first seconds
- "Loading" animation before reveal

### AI Hook Goal

Make viewers think "how was this made?" immediately.
