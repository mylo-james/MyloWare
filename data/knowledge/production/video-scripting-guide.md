# Video Scripting Guide

Structure, pacing, and beats for short-form video scripts.

## Script Structure

### The 3-Act Micro-Structure

Even 15-second videos follow a structure:

```
+---------------------------------------------+
|  ACT 1: HOOK (0-3 seconds)                  |
|  -> Grab attention, create curiosity         |
+---------------------------------------------+
|  ACT 2: VALUE (3-X seconds)                 |
|  -> Deliver content, build tension           |
+---------------------------------------------+
|  ACT 3: PAYOFF (Final 2-3 seconds)          |
|  -> Resolution, CTA, or twist                |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

### Time Allocation by Length

| Video Length | Hook | Value | Payoff |
|--------------|------|-------|--------|
| 15 seconds | 2s | 10s | 3s |
| 30 seconds | 3s | 22s | 5s |
| 60 seconds | 3s | 50s | 7s |

## Hook Writing

### Hook Types

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Question** | Pose intriguing question | "What happens if you...?" |
| **Statement** | Bold claim | "Nobody talks about this..." |
| **Visual** | Striking image | Show end result first |
| **Pattern interrupt** | Unexpected element | Mid-action start |
| **Direct address** | Call out viewer | "If you're struggling with X..." |

### Hook Formula

```
[Attention grab] + [Promise of value] + [Curiosity gap]
```

**Example**: "This trick took me from 0 to 10K followers" (attention + value + how?)

## Beat Structure

### What is a "Beat"?

A beat is a moment where something changes:
- New information
- Emotional shift
- Visual change
- Story progression

### Beat Pacing

| Video Length | Beats | Pace |
|--------------|-------|------|
| 15 seconds | 3-4 | Every 4-5s |
| 30 seconds | 5-7 | Every 4-6s |
| 60 seconds | 8-12 | Every 5-7s |

### Beat Types

| Beat | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Hook beat** | Initial attention grab |
| **Setup beat** | Context or problem |
| **Development beats** | Build tension/value |
| **Pivot beat** | Twist or turn |
| **Payoff beat** | Resolution |
| **CTA beat** | Action prompt |

## Script Templates

```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "Here's a trick most people don't know..."
[3-8s]  PROBLEM: "If you've ever struggled with X..."
[8-20s] SOLUTION: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3
[20-27s] RESULT: "And now you have Y"
[27-30s] CTA: "Follow for more tips"
```

### Story/Journey (30s)

```
[0-3s]  HOOK: Start with the climax or twist
[3-10s] SETUP: "It started when..."
[10-20s] DEVELOPMENT: Build tension
[20-27s] RESOLUTION: Payoff moment
[27-30s] REFLECTION: Lesson or emotion
```

### Satisfying/ASMR (30s)

```
[0-2s]  HOOK: Most visually striking moment
[2-5s]  SETUP: Show the object/setup
[5-25s] PROCESS: The satisfying action
[25-28s] REVEAL: Final result
[28-30s] LOOP: Seamless transition to start
```

## Pacing Techniques

### Keep Momentum

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Cut to new angle every 3-5s | Stay on one shot too long |
| Add text at key moments | Leave dead air |
| Use music to drive pace | Let energy drop |
| Vary shot types | Repetitive framing |

### Pacing by Content Type

| Content | Pace | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| Comedy | Fast | Punch timing matters |
| Tutorial | Medium | Need comprehension |
| ASMR | Slow | Relaxation is the goal |
| Hype/Energy | Very fast | Match the emotion |
| Story | Variable | Serve the narrative |

## Writing for AI Video Generation

### Prompt Script Format

When writing for AI-generated video:

```
SCENE 1 (0-5s):
Visual: [Detailed description of what's shown]
Camera: [Movement, angle]
Audio: [Sound effects, music, voice]

SCENE 2 (5-10s):
...
```

### Example AI Script

```
SCENE 1 (0-3s): HOOK
Visual: Extreme close-up of glass strawberry, light refracting
Camera: Slow dolly out
Audio: Soft ambient music, crisp tapping sound

SCENE 2 (3-15s): PROCESS
Visual: Knife slowly cutting through glass strawberry, satisfying slice
Camera: Static medium shot, centered in frame
Audio: Crisp cutting sounds, ASMR quality

SCENE 3 (15-18s): REVEAL
Visual: Both halves of glass strawberry, internal details visible
Camera: Slow zoom in
Audio: Music swell, soft glass clink
```

## Dialogue Writing

### Short-Form Dialogue Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Front-load key info | Viewers may drop off |
| Use conversational tone | Feels authentic |
| Keep sentences short | Easy to follow |
| Repeat key terms | Reinforces message |
| End with clear takeaway | Memorable conclusion |

### Voice/Narration Pacing

| Words per second | Feel |
|------------------|------|
| 2.0-2.5 wps | Slow, deliberate |
| 2.5-3.0 wps | Normal, comfortable |
| 3.0-3.5 wps | Energetic |
| 3.5+ wps | Fast, urgent |

For 30-second video with narration: ~75-90 words total

## Text Overlay Scripting

### When to Use Text

| Use Case | Placement |
|----------|-----------|
| Hook reinforcement | First 1-2 seconds |
| Key points | At relevant moments |
| Subtitles | Throughout (optional) |
| CTA | Final seconds |

### Text Timing

- Appear: 0.2-0.3s fade in
- Hold: 2-4 seconds minimum
- Exit: 0.2-0.3s fade out or cut

### Text Script Format

```
[0:00] "Wait for this..."
[0:03] "Step 1: Do X"
[0:08] "Step 2: Do Y"
[0:15] "The result?"
[0:25] "Follow for more"
```

## Common Mistakes

### Script Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Slow start | Viewers leave | Hook in first 2s |
| Too much setup | Bores audience | Cut to the good part |
| No clear structure | Feels random | Use templates |
| Weak ending | Forgettable | Strong payoff + CTA |
| Too much info | Overwhelming | One idea per video |
| No emotional hook | Doesn't connect | Add why it matters |
