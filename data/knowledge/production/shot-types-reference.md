## Shot Sizes

### Distance from Subject

| Shot | Abbreviation | Shows | Use For |
|------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Extreme Wide** | EWS | Environment, tiny subject | Establishing, scale |
| **Wide/Full** | WS | Full body + environment | Context, movement |
| **Medium Wide** | MWS | Knees up | Action with context |
| **Medium** | MS | Waist up | Dialogue, interaction |
| **Medium Close-Up** | MCU | Chest up | Conversation, emotion |
| **Close-Up** | CU | Face fills frame | Emotion, detail |
| **Extreme Close-Up** | ECU | Single feature | Intense emotion, tiny detail |

### Visual Reference

```
EWS:    [............tiny person............]
WS:     [.....full body + environment.....]
MWS:    [....person from knees up....]
MS:     [...waist up...]
MCU:    [chest up]
CU:     [face]
ECU:    [eye]
```

## Camera Angles

### Vertical Angles

| Angle | Effect | Use For |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Bird's Eye** | Overhead, looking straight down | Patterns, food, flat-lay |
| **High Angle** | Looking down at subject | Vulnerability, smallness |
| **Eye Level** | Neutral, straight on | Natural, conversational |
| **Low Angle** | Looking up at subject | Power, dominance, heroic |
| **Worm's Eye** | Ground level looking up | Dramatic, imposing |

### Horizontal Angles

| Angle | Description | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Front** | Face-to-face | Direct, confrontational |
| **3/4 (45°)** | Slight turn | Cinematic, depth |
| **Profile (90°)** | Side view | Dramatic, stylized |
| **Over-the-shoulder** | Behind one person | POV, conversation |

### Dutch Angle

- Camera tilted to one side
- Creates unease, tension, energy
- Use sparingly

## Camera Movements

### Movement Types

| Movement | Description | Effect |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Static** | Camera doesn't move | Stable, controlled |
| **Pan** | Horizontal rotation | Reveals, follows action |
| **Tilt** | Vertical rotation | Reveals height, drama |
| **Dolly** | Camera moves forward/back | Intimacy, emphasis |
| **Truck** | Camera moves left/right | Following, parallel |
| **Crane** | Vertical movement up/down | Scale, grandeur |
| **Zoom** | Lens focal length change | Focus shift, emphasis |

### Movement Terminology for AI Prompts

| Prompt Term | What It Does |
|-------------|--------------|
| `slow dolly in` | Gradually moves closer |
| `slow dolly out` | Gradually moves away |
| `pan left/right` | Rotates horizontally |
| `tilt up/down` | Rotates vertically |
| `tracking shot` | Follows subject movement |
| `orbit around` | Circles the subject |
| `push in` | Moves toward (dolly + zoom) |
| `pull out` | Moves away |

## Composition

### Rule of Thirds

```
+---+---+---+
| * |   | * |  <- Power points
+---+---+---+     (place subjects here)
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
| * |   | * |
+---+---+---+
```

### Framing Techniques

| Technique | Description | Use |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Center frame** | Subject in center | Direct attention, symmetry |
| **Thirds** | Subject on third lines | Dynamic, cinematic |
| **Lead room** | Space in direction of gaze | Natural feel |
| **Headroom** | Space above head | Comfortable framing |
| **Negative space** | Empty areas | Mood, minimalism |

### Vertical Video Composition

For 9:16 format:
- Subject often centered
- Stack elements vertically
- More headroom than horizontal
- Action in upper 2/3 (avoid bottom UI)

## Shot Sequences

### Basic Coverage

| Shot | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Establishing (wide) | Show location/context |
| Master (medium) | Main action/dialogue |
| Coverage (various) | Details, reactions |
| Insert (close-up) | Important details |

### Action Sequence

1. **Wide**: Show the space
2. **Medium**: The action begins
3. **Close-up**: Key moment
4. **Reaction**: Response to action
5. **Result**: Outcome

### Dialogue Sequence

1. **Two-shot**: Both people
2. **Over-shoulder A**: Person A speaking
3. **Over-shoulder B**: Person B responding
4. **Close-ups**: Emotional beats
