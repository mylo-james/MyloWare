## What Performs Best on TikTok

### Food and Cooking ASMR

- Dominating the platform
- Chopping, sizzling, crunching sounds
- Silent cooking videos (no talking)
- Mukbang with loud crunches/slurps

### "Oddly Satisfying" Visual + Sound

- Slime poking/stretching
- Kinetic sand slicing
- Soap cutting
- Paint mixing
- Close-up, vertical frame essential

### Fast Trigger Compilations

TikTok ASMR differs from YouTube:
- Multiple triggers in one short video
- "100 triggers in 1 minute" format
- Rapid cycling: tap -> brush -> crinkle -> scratch
- Brevity and variety win on feed

### Creative Object Triggers

- Makeup/skincare routine sounds
- Daily routine ASMR (hair brushing, cleaning)
- Art and craft sounds
- Unusual household items

## Audio vs. Visual: The Balance

### Audio is Primary

> "ASMR is most commonly triggered by specific auditory stimuli."

- Sound triggers induce ASMR more reliably
- Closing eyes and listening can still give tingles
- Watching without sound usually less effective

### Visual's Role

- Grabs attention on scrolling feed
- Establishes context quickly
- Creates intimacy (eye contact, gestures)
- Enhances but doesn't replace audio

### The TikTok Formula

```
Visual hook (stops scroll) + Audio delivery (provides tingles)
```

Both required for success. Audio must be crisp and front-center.

## Pacing and Rhythm

### Slow and Deliberate

- Traditional ASMR style
- Unhurried movements and speech
- Pauses build anticipation
- Lower-pitched, complex sounds work best

### Fast "Chaos" Style

- Popular on TikTok for attention spans
- Rapid trigger succession
- Multiple triggers per short video
- Works for "ASMR ADD" viewers

### Rhythmic Patterns

| Technique | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Steady patterns (1-2-3) | Entrains brain, quick tingles |
| Predictable repetition | Relaxing and soothing |
| Pattern breaking | Surprise -> fresh tingle wave |
| Anticipation pauses | Heightens next trigger |

### Pacing Rules

- Consistent volume (no sudden spikes)
- Even pressure and speed
- Gradual intensity changes (soft -> slightly more)
- No awkward fumbling or dead time
