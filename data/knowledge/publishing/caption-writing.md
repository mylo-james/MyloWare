## Caption Mistakes

### What to Avoid

| Mistake | Why |
|---------|-----|
| "Link in bio" repeatedly | Feels salesy, algorithm may suppress |
| "Follow for part 2" | Engagement bait, can backfire |
| All caps throughout | Feels like shouting |
| No caption at all | Misses SEO opportunity |
| Essay-length every time | Most people won't read |
| Hashtags before caption | Looks cluttered |

### Better Alternatives

| Instead of | Try |
|------------|-----|
| "Follow for more" | (Just make good content) |
| "Like if you agree" | "Which one resonates with you?" |
| "Link in bio!!" | "DM 'guide' for the link" |
| No CTA | "Save this for later 📌" |
