## Hashtag Strategy Overview

### Purpose of Hashtags

| Function | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Categorization** | Tells algorithm what your video is about |
| **Discovery** | Helps interested users find your content |
| **Community** | Connects you to niche audiences |
| **Trends** | Rides momentum of popular topics |

### The 3-2-1 Formula

| Type | Count | Examples |

| **Niche-specific** | 3 | #soapcutting #ASMRtapping #glassfruit |
| **Broader community** | 2 | #ASMR #oddlysatisfying |

**Total**: 5-6 hashtags per video

## Finding Good Hashtags

### Research Methods

| Method | How To |
|--------|--------|
| **TikTok search** | Type keyword, see suggested tags |
| **Competitor analysis** | Check what successful creators use |
| **Trending tab** | Browse Discover page |
| **Hashtag views** | Check view counts on tags |
| **Related hashtags** | TikTok suggests related tags |

### Hashtag Quality Indicators

| Indicator | Good Sign | Bad Sign |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **View count** | 100K - 500M | Too low (<10K) or too high (>10B) |
| **Recent content** | Fresh videos in feed | Stale, old content |
| **Content match** | Similar to yours | Unrelated videos |
| **Competition** | Mix of sizes | Only huge accounts |

### Sweet Spot Ranges

| Size | View Count | Use For |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Small/Niche** | 10K - 1M | Primary discovery |
| **Medium** | 1M - 100M | Community building |
| **Large** | 100M - 1B | Broader reach |
| **Massive** | 1B+ | Use sparingly, high competition |

## Hashtag Categories

### Niche Hashtags (Most Important)

Specific to your exact content:

```
ASMR: #asmrsounds #asmrslime #asmreating #asmrrelaxation
Satisfying: #satisfyingvideos #satisfyingasmr #oddlysatisfying
Food: #foodasmr #mukbang #eatingsounds
Art: #arttok #satisfyingart #paintmixing
```

### Community Hashtags

Connect to broader audiences:

```
#fyp #foryou #viral (very generic, minimal impact)
#asmrcommunity #tiktokasmr #relaxing
#satisfying #mindblowing #soothing
```

### Trend Hashtags

Currently popular (changes weekly):
- Check Discover page
- Watch what's trending
- Only use if genuinely relevant

### Format Hashtags

Describe the content format:

```
#pov #grwm #storytime #tutorial #howto
```

## What NOT to Do

### Hashtag Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad |
|---------|--------------|
| Using #fyp #foryoupage | Too generic, no real benefit |
| Irrelevant trending tags | Confuses algorithm, looks spammy |
| 15+ hashtags | Diminishing returns, looks desperate |
| Only huge hashtags | Too much competition |
| Hashtag stuffing | Caption looks cluttered |
| Banned hashtags | Shadowban risk |

### Potentially Problematic Tags

Some hashtags are restricted or watched closely:
- Anything related to self-harm
- Political tags during elections
- Medical misinformation topics
- Certain weight/diet terms

---

## Hashtag Placement

### In Caption

```
Good caption structure:

"The most satisfying sound you'll hear today 🎧

#asmr #satisfying #glasscutting #oddlysatisfying #relaxing"
```

### Best Practices

| Practice | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Put hashtags at end | Caption text reads cleaner |
| Separate from main caption | Visual clarity |
| Don't hide in comments | Less effective than caption |
| Use relevant emojis | Visual appeal |

---

## Testing Hashtag Effectiveness

### What to Track

| Metric | How to Find |
|--------|-------------|
| Views from hashtags | TikTok Analytics (Pro account) |
| Hashtag ranking | Search the tag, see if your video appears |
| Overall reach | Compare videos with different tags |

### A/B Testing Approach

1. Post similar content
2. Use different hashtag sets
3. Track which performs better
4. Refine over time

### Iteration Cycle

```
Week 1: Use Set A -> Track performance
Week 2: Use Set B -> Track performance
Week 3: Compare -> Keep winners
Week 4: Test new variations
```

## Hashtag Research Workflow

### For Each Video

1. **Identify content topic** - What is this video actually about?
2. **Search TikTok** - Find 10-15 relevant tags
3. **Check view counts** - Aim for range of sizes
4. **Verify relevance** - Are the videos in those tags similar?
5. **Select final 5-6** - Mix of niche, community, trend
6. **Monitor performance** - Adjust for next video

### Building a Hashtag Library

Create sets for different content types:

```
ASMR General:
#asmr #asmrsounds #relaxing #satisfying #tingles

ASMR Food:
#foodasmr #eatingsounds #mukbang #crunchyasmr #asmreating

ASMR Objects:
#tappingasmr #scratchingasmr #glassasmr #oddlysatisfying

Satisfying Visuals:
#satisfying #satisfyingvideos #oddlysatisfying #soothing
```
